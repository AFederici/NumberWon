It would be wrong to speculate on what these might look like or to suggest that free movement will continue as it is now.\"\\n\\nThe British government has for years failed to meet a pledge to reduce net migration below 100,000 a year. May\\'s spokesman said it would take time to get the numbers down, but the government was committed to doing so.\\n\\nFinance minister Philip Hammond said last week that there should be no immediate change to immigration rules when Britain leaves the bloc, and Interior Minister Amber Rudd said there would be no \\'cliff edge\\' on leaving the EU.\\n\\nBut Trade Minister Liam Fox said allowing free movement after Brexit would not \"keep faith\" with the referendum result and that the government had not reached a consensus on keeping open EU immigration for a transitional period.\\n\\nThe length of a potential transition period to allow business to adapt to the potential upheaval caused by Brexit is another contentious issue. There has been no clear guidance from May\\'s team on how long the transition should be.\\n\\nBrexit \"Civil War\"\\n\\nVince Cable, leader of the pro-EU Liberal Democrats said the \"civil war\" within May\\'s cabinet over Brexit was now so serious she should return from her holiday and take charge.\\n\\n\"There are more government positions than there are cabinet ministers. The government is in total disarray. Unless the cabinet can agree a position how can it possibly negotiate Brexit on behalf of Britain with the EU?,\" he said.\\n\\nThe EU\\'s top Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told EU ambassadors last week that negotiations on the future relationship between Britain and the EU are now less likely to start in October due to a lack of progress at the initial stage of talks about the breakup.\\n\\nHammond was also reported as saying Britain does not intend to lower taxes far below the European average in order to remain competitive after Brexit, contradicting comments he himself had made earlier in the year.\\n\\nThe pro-Brexit UK Independence Party said remain-supporting ministers were now \"actively promoting confusion and uncertainty\" in order to undermine Brexit negotiations and seek to reverse the process.\\n\\nMay\\'s spokesman said there was broad agreement across government and within her team of ministers about the need to make Brexit as smooth as possible. The government position on Brexit remains as set out by May in a January speech, he added.\\n\\nHe cited comments from that speech in which May said that it was \"in no-one\\'s interests for there to be a cliff edge for business\" but that this did not mean seeking \"some form of unlimited transitional status\".\\n\\nThe details of any implementation period are to be negotiated but the government is not looking for an \"off-the-shelf model\", he said, after a Financial Times report that Hammond hoped for such an option.',\n",

Tefft briefed employees on the Russian decision - the toughest diplomatic demarche between the two countries since the Cold War.\\n\\n\"The atmosphere was like a funeral,\" said one person present, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to talk to the media.\\n\\nLate on Monday, a stand-off was developing outside a diplomatic compound in the Moscow suburbs that the Kremlin is confiscating from the U.S. embassy as part of its package of retaliatory measures.\\n\\nEmbassy trucks sent to retrieve diplomatic property from the site were being denied entry, in what the embassy said was a violation of an undertaking from the Russian authorities.\\n\\nPutin said on Sunday Russia was ordering the United States to cut 755 diplomatic staff by September and seizing two properties. The move, he said, was in reaction to Congressional approval for a new round of sanctions against Moscow.\\n\\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that the 755 could include Russian citizens, a group who comprise the vast majority of the United States\\' roughly 1,200 embassy and consulate staff in Russia.\\n\\nThe clarification from the Kremlin means that there will not necessarily be a mass expulsion of U.S. diplomats because the numbers to be cut can be made up from Russian staff.\\n\\nReducing their numbers will affect embassy and consular operations, but that step does not carry the same diplomatic impact as expelling U.S. diplomats from Russia.\\n\\nCommenting on which diplomatic staff would have to go, Peskov told reporters on a conference call: \"That\\'s the choice of the United States.\"\\n\\nHe added: \"(It\\'s) diplomats and technical employees. That is, we\\'re not talking purely about diplomats - obviously, there isn\\'t that number of diplomats - but about people with non-diplomatic status, and people hired locally, and Russian citizens who work there.\"\\n\\nRelated Coverage\\n\\nA U.S. State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, called Russia\\'s action \"a regrettable and uncalled-for act ... We are assessing the impact of such a limitation and how we will respond to it\".\\n\\nAs of 2013, the U.S. mission in Russia, including the Moscow embassy and consulates in St Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Vladivostok, employed 1,279 staff, according to a State Department Inspector General\\'s report that year. That included 934 \"locally employed\" staff and 301 U.S. \"direct-hire\" staff.\\n\\nForcing the United States to scale back its diplomatic presence will reinforce Putin\\'s reputation at home as a resolute defender of Russia\\'s interests.

Picture taken July 30, 2017.Khalid al-Mousily\\n\\nMOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - A senior Iraqi general predicted a relatively easy victory for his forces in the upcoming battle for the Islamic State haven of Tal Afar as up 2,000 fighters and their families there are \"worn out and demoralised\".\\n\\nLess than one month after declaring victory in the city of Mosul, Iraqi forces are poised to attack Tal Afar, which is around 40 km to the west of Mosul, in what will be the next major battle against the militants.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t expect it will be a fierce battle even though the enemy is surrounded,\" Major-General Najm al-Jabouri told Reuters in an interview.\\n\\nJabouri, a key battlefield commander, said the fight would be simple compared to the nine months of gruelling urban combat in Mosul, which took a heavy toll on Iraqi forces.\\n\\n\"The enemy is very worn out,\" said Jabouri, who was mayor of Tal Afar when it was overrun by insurgents more than a decade ago. \"I know from the intelligence reports that their morale is low,\" the general added.\\n\\nThe city, with about 200,000 residents before falling to Islamic State, experienced cycles of sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shi\\'ites after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and produced some of Islamic State\\'s most senior commanders.\\n\\nIt has also become the focus of a wider regional struggle for influence. Turkey, which claims affinity with Tal Afar\\'s predominantly ethnic Turkmen population, opposes the involvement of Shi\\'ite paramilitary groups fighting with Iraqi forces, some of which are backed by Iran.\\n\\nJabouri estimated there were between 1,500 and 2,000 militants left in Tal Afar. The figure may include some family members who support them.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a large number, but the terrain is favourable (to Iraqi forces),\" Jabouri said. Only one part of the city, Sarai, is comparable to Mosul\\'s Old City, where Iraqi troops were forced to advance on foot through narrow streets. The rest of Tal Afar can be navigated in tanks and armoured vehicles.\\n\\nForeign Fighters\\n\\nUnlike Mosul, where Islamic State effectively held hundreds of thousands of people hostage to slow the advances of Iraqi forces, Jabouri said few civilians remained in Tal Afar, except those related to the militants.\\n\\nIraqi forces expect to face bombs, snipers and booby-traps. Despite being surrounded, there is no sign the militants are running low on ammunition, Jabouri said.\\n\\nMany local Turkmen members of Islamic State already managed to escape by mingling with displaced civilians and fled to Turkey, where they can blend in anonymously, Jabouri said.\\n\\nAn Iraqi top army generals, Major General Najm Abdullah al-Jubbouri speaks during an interview with Reuters in Mosul, Iraq July 30, 2017.

McMaster routed the insurgents.\\n\\nThe city stabilised, and McMaster\\'s approach was held up as a blueprint for successful counter-insurgency strategy, but in years to come Tal Afar lapsed back into communal violence and insurgents took root again.\\n\\nJabouri says he met with McMaster, who is now U.S. National Security Adviser, around one month ago and they discussed Tal Afar. \"It was different,\" said Jabouri, comparing the past battle with the future one.\\n\\nIslamic State is more formidable an enemy than al Qaeda was, he said, but Iraqi forces have also gained experience over three years of fighting the group.\\n\\nThe U.S. role is less conspicuous this time, and the historic citadel is no longer standing because Islamic State blew it up.',\n",

But Shahbaz\\'s accession is nonetheless almost guaranteed due to PML-N\\'s hefty majority in parliament, and it adds to Pakistan\\'s long history of dynastic politics.\\n\\nPro-Business, Pragmatic\\n\\nShahbaz\\'s governing style is in sharp contrast to Nawaz\\'s hands-off approach, but the two brothers espouse a similar pro-business ideology.\\n\\nTheir biggest difference may be in their relations with the military, which plays an outsized role in Pakistani politics and currently controls key areas of policy such as relations with India and the United States.\\n\\nAnalysts say Shahbaz has cultivated better ties with the generals, who cut short the second of Nawaz\\'s three stints in power with a coup in 1999.\\n\\n\"It is well known that Shahbaz Sharif is more practical, more pragmatic vis-a-vis the army,\" said Khaled Ahmed, an author and contributing editor to Newsweek Pakistan.\\n\\nA political source close to the ousted prime minister said Shahbaz believes civilians must grow the $300 billion economy and boost development before they can try to rein in the military establishment.\\n\\n\"I have listened to him talk about this...and he thinks it\\'s a matter of decades before the civilians can interfere with the military,\" said the source.\\n\\nA less antagonist relationship with the military may bode well for his premiership in a nation where the army has a history of staging coups or helping topple governments.\\n\\nTough Taskmaster\\n\\nShahbaz\\'s critics say his preference for a small cadre of advisers over elected provincial ministers has limited his popularity within PML-N, and he has never challenged his brother\\'s authority.\\n\\nFew expect that to change. A senior PML-N source said Nawaz would take a back seat, but would likely still call the shots on major policy issues.\\n\\n\"Nawaz\\'s decisions will be final,\" a senior PML-N official, who did not wish to be named, told Reuters. \"But I know Nawaz Sharif and he\\'s just not going be interfering too much. He\\'s not a micro-managing person.\"\\n\\nShahbaz could not be reached for comment.\\n\\nSeveral aides to Shahbaz paint a picture of a tough taskmaster, berating officials to ensure major infrastructure projects are finished on time.\\n\\nIn May, when a Chinese-built coal-fired power station was built in record time, PML-N took out newspaper adverts to boast of their achievement. A liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant was also built in record time.\\n\\nAnecdotes of Sharif mocking or lashing out against politicians and colleagues contrast with the deferential approach to his elder brother, a trait common in patriarchal Pakistani families.\\n\\n\"His biggest weakness is Nawaz Sharif,\" said one of Shahbaz\\'s close aides in Lahore.\\n\\nOpposition politicians who say PML-N wants to turn the nuclear-armed nation in a family fiefdom have begun to turn their crosshairs on Shahbaz, accusing him of corruption and vowing to use the judicial system to bring him down.\\n\\n\"This is not a democracy, this is a kingdom,\" said Imran Khan, leader of the opposition PTI party.\\n\\nShahbaz has filed a 10 billion rupees ($95 million) lawsuit against Khan after the former cricketer-turned-politician alleged a source close to Shahbaz offered him a bribe to drop the Supreme Court case against Nawaz.\\n\\nWealthy Upbringing\\n\\nShahbaz, second of three children of industrialist Mian Muhammad Sharif, was born four years after Pakistan\\'s independence from British colonial rule in 1947.\\n\\nHe joined the family business and entered politics at a time when Nawaz was Punjab\\'s chief minister in the 1980s.\\n\\nShahbaz followed in Nawaz\\'s footsteps to become Punjab chief in the 1990s, but was exiled after the 1999 coup. He returned from exile to rule Punjab again from 2008, becoming a huge political asset to his brother.\\n\\nHe has also faced corruption allegations but has dismissed them as politically motivated.\\n\\nAnalysts said Shahbaz was likely to focus on completing infrastructure projects ahead of an election due in mid-2018, especially power projects aimed at denting daily blackouts that have angered voters.\\n\\n\"If he can just make sure that those issues in the power sector are alleviated, PML-N has a very good chance to getting re-elected,\" said Vahaj Ahmed, a research analyst at investment bank Exotix Partners.\\n\\nShahbaz\\'s son Hamza is now being considered for the post of Punjab chief minister, an issue that splits opinion with the party.\\n\\n\"We become a serious, mature political party if we find someone out of the family,\" said the senior PML-N official. \"But that may be a bridge too far for us\".',\n",
