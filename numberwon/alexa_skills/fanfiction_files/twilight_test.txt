<p>Hi. I'm Katherine Dobrev and I'm a werewolf. A different one though, I don't have to be in werewolf form to run and vampires don't reek to me and I don't reek to vampires. I can read minds too, but if I don't want someone to read my mind just pretty much flick a switch and my mind is blocked.</p> <p>I HATE EDWARD CULLEN. HE HATES ME.</p> <p>Yup, I usually stay with the Cullens. Sam keeps getting on my nerves. </p> <p>Best Friend: Basically everyone but Edward. Bella is OKAY. </p> <p>So, that girl over there is me. (A/N just pretend she has emerald green eyes)</p> <p>Warm, ya know like a werwolf.</p> <p>(A/N Bella and Edward were just together they never married or had Nessie)</p> <p>I play piano but no one knows that so tell them and I'll kill you.</p> <p>I stay at the Cullens so often that I have my own room. Rose decorated it, it looks great =)</p> <p>(A/N In my version the Cullen's house is so big you can get lost in it BTW)</p> <p>Carlisle and Esme are great, like my mom and dad (they died =(  )</p> <p>Emmett is so funny and loves to help me play jokes on Edward.</p> <p>Alice is all perky and fun, LOVE HER.</p> <p>Rose doesn't like Bella all that much either and we're like best friends</p> <p>Jasper is cool. I help him with his 'hunger issues' and he helps me with my Edward-caused anger issues.</p> <p>Edward......HE SUCKS AND I HATE HIM.</p> <p>Yea that's pretty much me =)</p> <p>Please comment, they mean so much :D<p>Hello. I'm Edward Cullen. I go to Forks High School.</p> <p>You probably know who I am. If you do, then you'll know that I HATE Katherine Dobrev who, sadly, is usually here.</p> <p>Before you go thinking that I really like her deep down and I just think it's hate, think again.</p> <p>I hate her, she hates me. That's just how it works.</p> <p>Although I hate her, I would never wish her dead. I would wish for her to go away, but never dead.</p> <p>Anyway, I'm a vampire and strangely, the annoying werewolf doesn't smell to me.</p> <p>Yet, her<em> friend </em>Jacob reeks like crazy and she ends up smelling like him.</p> <p>The worst part is that she has this mind block thing so I could never know what she's going to do to me. Last week she and Emmett painted my Volvo <em>pink</em>. Who knows what else.</p> <p>Not that she isn't the only one who has all the fun.</p> <p>I put powder in her hairdryer once. It was so funny and her mind block wasn't on so every single curse word I heard.</p> <p>Well, I love Bella. But lately she's been spending a lot of time with Jacob. A <em>lot</em> of time with Jacob.</p> <p>But he's going through that changing time so that's probably why.</p> <p>Alice is the BEST sister in the world and Emmett is the best brother in the world.</p> <p>I love my entire family I don't know what I would do without them.</p> <p>That's enough about me now. Time to see what other things I could do to annoy the hell out of Kat.</p> <p><p><strong>The bedroom is Katherine's BTW</strong></p> <p><strong>__________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I woke up. Ew. It's a Monday. I have school. EEEEEWWW. I was at the Cullens, as usual. Sam pissed me off again. He said I couldn't go see the Cullens anymore. So I went.</p> <p>Yeah, that's kinda a fact about me. Once you tell me I can't do something I do it. As long as it doesn't hurt me, other people or against the law.</p> <p>I went to the bathroom and got dressed. The reason I don't go to the same school as my pack's is because....well Forks has air-condition.</p> <p>And I LOVE the cold. Rainy days are my favourite.</p> <p>I came into my room wearing a a black vest, a light brown skirt with black leggings underneath and boots. I left my hair down.</p> <p>I went downstairs. Everyone was there except Bella. We usually pick her up on the way.</p> <p>Esme had already made breakfast for me.</p> <p>I always feel bad about that because I'm the only one who eats here, and Esme usually cooks for me.</p> <p>"Good morning," I said.</p> <p>They all said good morning back and Rose came and sat next to me, staring.</p> <p>"What?" I asked through a mouthful of eggs.</p> <p>"How does that taste?" she asked.</p> <p>I shoved some in her mouth. "Like that," I said.</p> <p>"Oh," she said, her voice mumbled. I put a lot in her mouth.</p> <p>I giggled. Soom she began laughing with me. That was the weird thing about us. What other people do to her, she gives them the evil eye. When I do it, it's funny.</p> <p>I finished eating and washed my plate. I hated to have Esme do more work because of me.</p> <p>"Time to go. we can't be late first day. Again," said Alice, glaring at Emmett.</p> <p>Last time, Emmett dressed up as Superman and decided he was wearing that to go to school.</p> <p>It took over half an hour for Edward and Jasper to get him changed.</p> <p>Emmett made a face at Alice. Them picked me up and slung me over his shoulder.</p> <p>"Then let's go nooooooooooooooow!!!" he yelled running outside with me still on his shoulder.</p> <p>"Emmett stop I just ate! I'll vomit on you if you don't put me down," I warned.</p> <p>I was set softly on the ground. "Thank you," I said.</p> <p>Edward came out. Annoying prick. "We'll take my car," he said.</p> <p>Good, good. Rosalie linked arms with me and we ran up to Edward to walk with him.</p> <p>You're probably wondering why would I walk with him when I hate him. You'll see.</p> <p>"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE???" Edward shouted.</p> <p>Rosalie, Emmett and I cracked up.</p> <p>On his Volvo there was a big sparkly red bow on it. Emmett occupied Edward while me and Rose sneaked out last night to do it.</p> <p>Even Alice and Jasper were stifling laughs.</p> <p>Edward tore off the bow and flung it at me.</p> <p>"What's the matter Edwardo? It looked kinda boring before," I said, still giggling.</p> <p>"Never do that again," he warned.</p> <p>"Ok. I won't do THAT again," I said thinking of all the other stuff I could do to his car.</p> <p>We got in and headed for Forks High School. We didn't have to pick up Bella again.</p> <p>Apparently, she got a new car. Good, she was annoying anyways.</p> <p>I don't like Bella at all. Why? Simple. I could read Bella's mind too even though Edward can't.</p> <p>She doesn't have a special block or anything. Something's just wrong with Edward.</p> <p>She's always thinking about Jake. Even when she's with Edward. And not in the friend way.</p> <p>I hate Edward but still. No one deserves to be treated like that, even though Edward doesn't know.</p> <p>She likes Jacob. You can tell. But she likes Edward too.</p> <p>Bella's in a mess. She really needs to sort herself out. Oh well.</p> <p>We arrived at Forks. EW.</p> <p>Please read, comment, vote, just let me know someone's reading, :)</p> <p></p> <p><p><strong>Btw when I say forks, I mean the High School. Too tired to write Forks High School :P</strong></p> <p><strong>Her bathroom is over there</strong></p> <p><strong>______________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I sighed. We were here. The worst place on Earth. I sighed again and came out Edward's stupid car.</p> <p>But it goes really fast so I love it. Too bad it's his :(</p> <p>I slung my bag over my shoulder and Alice and I walked over to Jessica and Mike.</p> <p>Yea we're friends with them. Well Alice and I are. Not sure about the others. Oh yea Bella is too.</p> <p>"Hey," said Jess.</p> <p>Alice and I said hi back. "Did you study for the test?" asked Mike.</p> <p>"What test!?!?!?!" I asked.</p> <p>"The science test. Mr. Darren said it's gonna be really hard," said Jessica.</p> <p>Oh well I thought. It's just school. So what if I fail a science test.</p> <p>Again.</p> <p>I walked in but I stopped at Edward's locker and slipped a few love notes in them when he wasn't looking.</p> <p>Yea, love notes. Signed by <em>Jacob.</em> Hehe.</p> <p>I ran off to class barely slipping in before the final bell rang.</p> <p>Oh yea you know what else sucks about school?</p> <p>ALL my classes are with Edward. How that happened is beyond me.</p> <p>I grabbed a seat in the back. I never liked being in front.</p> <p>It was a window seat too. I loved staring out the window.</p> <p>Especially when that boring old teacher starts talking. </p> <p>I don't even take notes. Bella does. I copy them off her when she's asleep and she spends the night at the Cullens. Which is kinda often.</p> <p>The stupid annoying lecture began. I zoned out.</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>I sat in class, idly drawing in the back of my book, waiting for geography class to start.</p> <p>I never took notes. I already knew the work. Sadly, Bella wasn't in this class.</p> <p>But the stupid werewolf was. I watched her as she walked in.</p> <p>Everyday I watch her whenever she walks in class. Why?</p> <p>I hope she falls and I don't want to miss that chance.</p> <p>Just then the teacher walked in. Gosh, I hated this lecture.</p> <p>So boring and the fact that he was an old teacher didn't help.</p> <p>His voice was as boring and annoying as Katherine's.</p> <p>Suddenly, most people's hands went up. Crap, he must've asked a question.</p> <p>"Katherine?" he called.</p> <p>"What???" she said, looking a little lost. Ha bet she didn't know the answer and would be getting detention.</p> <p>Yea it's not if you don't know the answer you get detention. It's if you constantly don't know the answer you get detention.</p> <p>"Can you answer the question?" Mr.West asked.</p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>CRAP. I had no clue what the answer was. Usually when he asked a question I flippd through my notes and look all studious. Too late for that.</p> <p>"Sure. The answer is....Africa," I said randomly.</p> <p>"Wrong. And I am tired of you not paying attention in class. You have detention for the rest of the week."</p> <p>I heared Edward snicker. Da* him.</p> <p>AAGGGHHHH WHY?!?!?! I was so pissed off.</p> <p>"Ok," I said and stared out the window again.</p> <p>Whenever teachers punish you they expect you to fight back and act real mad.</p> <p>Although I'm furious, I don't show it. I act as though I don't care and the teahcers get really mad on the inside.</p> <p>Mr. West walked over to my desk and slapped down the note. I put it in my bag and returned his stare. In the eye.</p> <p>He looked uncomfortable. My eyes were practically challenging him to do something.</p> <p>Mr. West walked off and continued with the boring lecture.</p> <p>Hmph. I had detention. For the rest of the week. FML.<p><strong>That's the Cullens house. Imagine a huge forest in the back.</strong></p> <p><strong>_____________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I grabbed my bag and walked out of class. What did I have now? Oh right. LUNCH. =)</p> <p>I stuffed my bag in my locker, pulled out my money and went in the cafeteria looking for Emmett.</p> <p>I needed someone to listen to me rant about detention. I found him and walked over.</p> <p>"Good day, love. Might I interest you in cup of tea?" he asked, while holding a plastic teacup. <em>Empty</em> teacup I might add.</p> <p>Great, my best friend became british.</p> <p>"I need someone to yell at for me getting detention," I said.</p> <p>"Alright, shall we take a seat over there?" he asked.</p> <p>I rolled my eyes and sat down.</p> <p>So I started to yell but then Alice came over with Jasper.</p> <p>"Hey---" she started but she was cut off by Emmett.</p> <p>"Blimey! Shut your pie hole!!!" yelled Emmett throwing the teacup at her.</p> <p>Alice gave him a confused look while Jasper stared at his now British brother.</p> <p>I sighed. Then yelled for about 5 minutes. Yea screaming my problems, or telling, to people or anything really is what I do when I'm pissed.</p> <p>Or listen to music.</p> <p>Jasper said he could stay back and pick me up for the rest of the week cause of stupid Mr. West.</p> <p>I thanked him and began thinking that this day maybe wasn't all that bad. Then the block of ice came over with the annoying wanna-be block of ice.</p> <p>"Hello," he said. They all responded. Except for me, of course.</p> <p>Edward threw a piece of paper at me. I opened it. Hehe it was the love notes.</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>"Oooo I think Jacob has a crush on you Edward," she said giggling like crazy.</p> <p>Annoying b*tch.</p> <p>I growled at her.</p> <p>She growled back.</p> <p>I was about to respond with another growl but Bella stopped us.</p> <p>"Guys, calm down," she said.</p> <p>My body immediately relaxed. Just hearing her voice made me feel better.</p> <p>Kat rolled her eyes and began talking to Emmett, who, for some reason, was talking back in a british accent. My brother.</p> <p>Bella and I began a conversation. She was so beautiful.</p> <p>I heard the stupid voices in my head. I blocked them out as usual.</p> <p>As much as I hate her, Katherine actually has it better than me. All she has to do is concentrate on someone and then she can read their minds.</p> <p>Hmmm...... her mind block wasn't on.</p> <p>I listened to her thoughts.</p> <p>D*mmit. She wasn't thinking about stuff to do to me.</p> <p>I usually read her mind so  I know that to look out for.</p> <p>It helped and none of her tricks worked for a few weeks. Then she began putting up the mind blocks.</p> <p>"Why is Emmett so weird??? And why do I have stupid detention? Why am I probably going to fail my science test this afternoon? Oh wait I know the answer for that one."</p> <p>Then she put up the mind block. I turned my attention back to Bella.</p> <p>She didn't seem to notice that I wasn't paying attention, she was still talking.</p> <p>The bell rang. Ugh, time to go back to class.</p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I ran to my locker and grabbed my bag. Only one more minute till the final bell.</p> <p>I turned and began running in the direction to class, bumping into someone.</p> <p>Instead of both of us falling, one of us did. ME.</p> <p>I looked up. Great, Edward was the idiot I bumped into. My life sucks.</p> <p>Scrambling to my feet, I ignored him and continued running to class. Then I stopped and turned around.</p> <p>"Aren't you going to science?" I asked</p> <p>He was walking in the opposite direction to the classroom and he had the same classes as me.</p> <p>"Shortcut," he said.</p> <p>"Oh. How bout you take that shortcut, but don't come to class? My day won't be so bad then," I said sweetly.</p> <p>Edward rolled his eyes and walked off.</p> <p>I grinned and ran to class, darting in right before the final bell rang.</p> <p>How did I do that in one minute? Speed. Being supernatural has its perks.</p> <p>Edward walked in. Idiot.</p> <p>The teacher walked in behind him, Mr. Darren.</p> <p>"Ok class I know we were going to have a test today, but my printer wasn't working so I decided we can all have blood tests!" he announced happily.</p> <p>What person in their right mind would be happy about a blood test???</p> <p>*Skip all the explaining*</p> <p>It ws my turn. I grabbed the pin and pierced my finger.</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>Oh great. A blood test and I don't have any blood.</p> <p>I watched the person next to my put the pin in their finger.</p> <p>I could control myself though. </p> <p>When the drop of blood began to fall I flicked my index finger and caught it.</p> <p>I used vampire speed so he didn't see a thing.</p> <p>I held the pin in my other hand to make it look as though I had already stuck myself.</p> <p>Suddenly, I smelled the most amazing scent ever. Someone's blood smelt amazing.</p> <p>Even better than Bella's</p> <p>I scanned everyone in the room, until I found the person.</p> <p>And I realized I knew the person.</p> <p>She looked at me.</p> <p><em>Katherine.</em></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><p><strong>Yea that's Kat's wolf over there. Just imagine the green eyes.</strong></p> <p><strong>_______________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>It was Katherine's blood. Katherine. <em>Katherine.</em></p> <p>How? How was it possible that she was a werewolf and her blood smells better to me than Bella's?</p> <p>No. Her blood smelt AMAZING.</p> <p>I was still staring at her. She gave me a weird look.</p> <p>I turned away. I raised my hand. I couldn't stay here anymore.</p> <p>Who knows what I might do if took in another breath.</p> <p>"May I be excused, Mr. Darren?" I asked.</p> <p>He nodded. I walked out as fast as I can.</p> <p>I wasn't going back. It had 3 more periods after Science, but I couldn't go back.</p> <p>I began to run to the forest. The fastest I ever ran before.</p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>Stalker. Staring at me like I was some kind of demon.</p> <p>S. T. A. L. K. E. R. Only word suited for Edward Cullen.</p> <p>Then all of a sudden he had to be excused. Probably the smell of blood everywhere.</p> <p>I glanced out the window. Wtf? He was running in the forest.</p> <p>Most people come back to class when they ask to be excused. Edward runs away.</p> <p>Sucker. Mr. Darren took our blood samples. He said he would send it to the lab or wherever they test it and we would get the results next class.</p> <p>As if we care.</p> <p>I walked out of the stupid classroom. English now. </p> <p>I hate English. And the worst part?</p> <p>It's the only subject we're taught in school that would actually be some use to us.</p> <p>*Skip all the classes*</p> <p>I walked outside to the parking lot. Everyone was standing next to the Volvo.</p> <p>"What's up?" I asked.</p> <p>"Edward, apparently, isn't here. And he has the keys," said Jasper.</p> <p>"No problem," I said.</p> <p>I jacked open the door and hot-wired the car.</p> <p>Yeah, I know how to do that. And pick locks. And pick-pocket.</p> <p>What? I know Jacob, who decided these 'skills' would be useful.</p> <p>Everyone got in. I took the wheel.</p> <p>The minute I pulled out from the parking lot I drove as fast as the car could possibly go.</p> <p>Hehe, I wanted to this for so long. Edward's car was the fastest out of everyone's. And he never let me drive it.</p> <p>It took us less than five minutes to get to the Cullens.</p> <p>I parked the car in the garage then went in to tell Carlisle and Esme I wouldn't be staying with them for a while.</p> <p>It was time to go to my pack.</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>I came back from my run. Oh shoot. I had to drive everyone home and I had the keys.</p> <p>Oh well, they were vampires they could've ran.</p> <p>I went to the parking lot to get my car and it wasn't there.</p> <p>Crap.</p> <p>I ran home and found my Volvo in the garage.</p> <p>I walked in the house.</p> <p>"Well, look the one who abandoned us," said Emmett.</p> <p>"So what, you could've ran home. How did my car get here?" I asked.</p> <p>"Kat knows how to hotwire a car so we DIDN'T have to run home," said Rose.</p> <p>"Oh."</p> <p>I went upstairs. I needed to sort out what happened in Science.</p> <p>Her blood. I can remember the exact scent. And I wanted to smell it again. To taste it.</p> <p>To drink it.</p> <p>NO! I can't drink a werewolf's blood. Besides, I only drink animal blood. Well, technically she was an animal, but it would still be wrong.</p> <p>I would go hunt tonight. Until I was practically drowning in blood.</p> <p>*Skip the day.*</p> <p>I opened the window and jumped outside then ran to a spot in the forest where a lot of animals usually are.</p> <p>I caught five deer and went looking for more.</p> <p>Suddenly I saw a wolf. With jet black fur and green eyes.</p> <p>Kat's green eyes.</p> <p>I had never seen her in werewolf form before, but I knew it was her.</p> <p>I walked towards her and put my hand on her head.</p> <p>I needed to talk to her. I hated her and she hated me but I needed to talk to her.</p> <p>Perks about two people being able to read minds: No one can hear your conversation.</p> <p>I asked her to talk and she glared at me but sat down.</p> <p>I sat opposite her and was about to start but she leapt up in pain.</p> <p>Kat had scrached herself against a piece of bark from the tree.</p> <p>A deep scratch.</p> <p>Blood began flowing out. Lots of it.</p> <p>The scent, the taste...so close right now............I needed it, just one drop.......<p><strong>The pic over there is Kat's room at the pack's house.</strong></p> <p>_______________________________________________________________________________</p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I saw Edward coming towards my scratch. What was he doing? I read his mind.</p> <p>Oh my gosh.</p> <p>I leapt away from him. My scratch healed just a second later. I ran behind some trees and shifted to my human form.</p> <p>"What the hell Edward?!?!?!" I screamed in his face.</p> <p>"I--I---uh--I don't know?" he said, not sounding sure at all.</p> <p>"My blood, you......like it???" I asked. Creepy, stalker dude, creepy.</p> <p>Edward nodded, looking kinda sheepish.</p> <p>"Well, control it leech. How can you like a <em>werewolf's</em> blood?"</p> <p>What was wrong with him. Annoying douche.</p> <p>"Yeah whatever. Go away. Your face is annoying me. Pig," he said.</p> <p>I cursed him right before phasing and running deeper in the woods.</p> <p>I never let him get the last word.</p> <p>I ran to a cliff where i sat in werewolf form, looking over at the sea. It was one of my favourite places.</p> <p>I soon fell asleep there, still in werewolf form.</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>Oh crap. I almost drank her blood. That was not good. And not because I wanted to drink the enemy's blood.</p> <p>It was because I knew if I started I wouldn't be able to stop. I could kill her.</p> <p>Actually, that mightn't be so bad.</p> <p>Idiot. I hated it when she got the last word. Kat knew I hated it too.</p> <p>Annoying witch.</p> <p>I ran back to my house and leapt into my room.</p> <p>I placed my Debussy CD in the stereo and put on my headphones.</p> <p>Suddenly, I didn't even hear the music anymore. In my mind was a new piece for the piano. I wrote it down on a sheet of music paper.</p> <p>It was the best thing that ever came into my head concerning music.</p> <p>(A/N Edward never wrote the piano song for Bella. In fact, he never wrote it at all. Well, not yet.)</p> <p>I lay  on the ground with the headphones in my ears.</p> <p>Being able to live forever and not being able to sleep can get really boring.</p> <p>Nothing to do but wait till the morning came.</p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I woke up somewhere in the middle of the night. I phased to my human form and pulled on my clothes.</p> <p>I ran back to the pack's house and jumped through the open window in my room.</p> <p>I actually like my room in the Cullens house more than this one. Oh well.</p> <p>I fell into my bed, literally fell, and went to sleep.</p> <p><em>Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.</em></p> <p>I stuck my hand out, felt blindly for the alarm clock and flung it at the wall.</p> <p>Yup, that's my alarm. It's the only thing annoying enough to make me get up.</p> <p>Except Edward's face.</p> <p>I went in the bathroom, did stuff you do not need to know, came out and pulled on a pair of skinny jeans, purple top and a black jacket.</p> <p>I went downstairs. Seth and Leah were already there.</p> <p>"Hey," I said.</p> <p>They responded. I went to get some cereal and ate it. Dry. I hate eating cereal with milk.</p> <p>It's disgusting.</p> <p>"I still don't understand how you can eat that without milk," said Leah.</p> <p>"I don't understand how you can eat it with milk," I shot back.</p> <p>She laughed. </p> <p>"Well, bye. I'm going to school now," I called, walking out the door.</p> <p>"No duuuuuuuuh," said Seth. I laughed and began to run to school.</p> <p>I don't have a car. And I like to run. I don't even get sweaty.</p> <p>Soon, I was at the stupid place. Why do we even come here? </p> <p>I saw the Cullens standing up at Edward's car.</p> <p>I began to walk over to them when a orange pick-up pulled into the parking lot.</p> <p>Bella's car. Driving very fast. Too fast to stop anytime soon.</p> <p>There was no mistaking it. Bella was smiling. I knew for sure I wasn't imagining it.</p> <p>There was one big grin on her face.</p> <p>The problem? Her car was heading directly at me.</p> <p>Bella didn't even try to stop. In fact, she probably increased the speed.</p> <p>And you couldn't have said she lost control.</p> <p>Her hands were firmly on the steering wheel. I read her mind. She <em>did</em> want to crash into me.</p> <p>A hit from a car actually can kill a werewolf. Depending on the speed and the impact. Bella's car was the really strong one. And she was going fast enought to kill me.</p> <p>We're not walls like vampires. Bella was planning to collide into me.</p> <p>To <em>kill me.</em></p> <p>I was paralysed. I honestly could not move.</p> <p>It wasn't from fright or horror or anything like that. I actually couldn't move.</p> <p>Good going, Kat. You're going to die in a school.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p><p><strong>That's her secret place. Just imagine it in the night. With rain. :D</strong></p> <p><strong>_______________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>Why??? I don't wanna die in a schol. I must have sinned really badly for my death to be here.</p> <p>Sorry, God.</p> <p>When Bella's car was a second away from me two figures were in front of me.</p> <p>I heard an extremely loud crash and then silence.</p> <p>I opened my eyes, which I didn't even realize were closed.</p> <p>Rosalie and Emmett stood in front of me. Bella's car was a wreck.</p> <p>Rose and Emmett were fine. I walked around and stood in front of them.</p> <p>"Thank you," I whispered.</p> <p>My knees buckled and Rosalie caught me before I could hit the ground.</p> <p>I pulled myself together and walked over to Bella.</p> <p>Who, unfortunately in my mind, was fine. Not one scratch.</p> <p>"What the hell Bella?!?! You tried to kill me! What is wrong with you?!?!?!" I screamed in her face.</p> <p>"Kat stop. She didn't mean to. She lost control. Didn't you Bella?" Edward asked.</p> <p>She put on a baby face and pretended to look scared and nodded.</p> <p>"Edward that is a total lie and you know it. Bella was driving staright at Kat!" said Alice.</p> <p>"She said it was an accident," Edward said. Apparently, he didn't want to believe his Bella tried to kill someone.</p> <p>Stupid head.</p> <p>"Edward you idiot! I read her mind. She was thinking that finally Katherine would be out of the way!" I yelled.</p> <p>"You can't read my mind, I have a special block," Bella said.</p> <p>Devil.</p> <p>"Yes I can read your mind you little witch! There's nothing special about your mind there's just something wrong with Edward!!!" I screamed.</p> <p>I couldn't take it anymore. I phased and ran into the forest.</p> <p>I needed to get away.</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>That was impossible. It was an accident. Bella said so.</p> <p>And now everyone was taking Katherine's side.</p> <p>I hated that girl. Bella clearly lost control of the car.</p> <p>"Edward! You're such an idiot! Kat could have been killed by your oh so precious Bella who drove the car directly toward her and you call it an accident!" Emmett shouted.</p> <p>"It was an accident," I said, standing up for Bella.</p> <p>"And why do you say that? Oh right, because Bella said so!" Alice screamed.</p> <p>"Not everything Bella says is right you know. She's not Google. She could tell lies. <em>Which she just did,</em>" said Jasper.</p> <p>(A/N I know they're in school but they reached extremely early so no one is there)</p> <p>I put my arm around Bella and walked off.</p> <p>Bella did not try to kill Katherine. I don't care what they said.</p> <p>Bella said she didn't, so she didn't.</p> <p>I took her home then tossed the pices of her car in the forest.</p> <p>Cars began to pull in the parking lot. Good, I finished just in time.</p> <p>None of my family were talking to me.</p> <p>I didn't care. They were wrong.</p> <p>I walked off to class.</p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>After I had cooled myself down in the woods, I phased and put on my clothes.</p> <p>I walked back to the Cullens. I wasn't going back to school.</p> <p>Carlisle and Esme were still home.</p> <p>"Hi Kat. Don't you still have school now?" asked Esme.</p> <p>"It's a long story,"I began.</p> <p>I sat down and told them everything that happened.</p> <p>"Are you ok? Hurt anywhere?" asked Carlisle.</p> <p>"I'm fine. It's just that I can't believe she would try to kill me. I never liked her but I didn't want to kill her," I said.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it," said Esme kindly, "Want me to make you something to eat?" she asked.</p> <p>"No thank you," I said, giving them a smile, "I'm just gonna go up to my room."</p> <p>"Well just tell us if you need anything," said Carlisle, looking a bit worried.</p> <p>I nodded and ran up the stairs.</p> <p>I fell asleep on my bed and only woke up when everyone had come back from school.</p> <p>I went downstairs. I needed to thank Emmett and Rose again.</p> <p>Ew. Bella was there.</p> <p>She walked up to me.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Katherine. I lost control of the car. I really didn't mean to hit you," she said sincerely.</p> <p>Total lie. It was all an act. </p> <p>Everyone's eyes were on me. I scanned their minds.</p> <p>Emmett: Liar. Kat wouldn't fall for that.</p> <p>Rose: Never liked her. Now I have a reason. She tried to kill my best friend!!!</p> <p>Alice: Thought she was nice. Then she tried to kill Kat. And claims it was an accident. Pft.</p> <p>Jasper: She's lying. I can actually feel the anger coming off of Kat.</p> <p>I figured that I might as well accept her apology.</p> <p>Let her think I like her. Everyone else knows that I don't so what the hell.</p> <p>"It's ok," I mumbled.</p> <p>Then I walked over to Emmett and Rosalie.</p> <p>"Thank you, again." I hugged them.</p> <p>I stared at Edward stright in the eye.</p> <p>"I still hate her. Why? She's lying. And you're an idiot to fall for her act." I said in my mind.</p> <p>I knew he was reading my mind. I walked outside.</p> <p>"I'll be back," I called.</p> <p>I took a long walk in the forest. It was raining. In the night.</p> <p>There was a special place I liked to go in times like these.</p> <p>I took my time, walking slowly, looking at every detail.</p> <p>Soon, I arrived. A smile came on my face. A big one.</p> <p>Thank goodness no one was here.</p> <p>They would have wondered who was this idiot grinning in the middle of the forest in the night.</p> <p>It was meeeeeee :)</p> <p>I climbed to the top and sat there.</p> <p>I stayed there until it stopped raining. Yes, I was soaking wet.</p> <p>I walked back to the Cullens and jumped through the window in my room.</p> <p>I took a hot shower and went to sleep.</p> <p>School tomorrow. I hate school.</p> <p>And now I have an actual reason.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I woke up and got ready for school as usual. I climbed out my window instead of the door.</p> <p>I really couldn't face anyone right now. I would run. Again.</p> <p>When I got there, the Cullens were now pulling in.</p> <p>They jumped out and came over to me.</p> <p>"Hey Kat. We missed you this morning," said Alice.</p> <p>"Yeah I just felt like running," I told her.</p> <p>We just talked until the bell rang for school to start.</p> <p>I went inside the classroom to my first period.</p> <p>Didn't learn a thing. I pretty much zoned out for the entire morning half.</p> <p>I shoved my bag in my locker after escaping from that classroom and went to the cafeteria.</p> <p>I took a tray and grabbed a Coke and an apple. I turned to walk to our usual table and guess what?</p> <p>Bella was there.</p> <p>Edward seemed to be the only one at the table who enjoyed her company.</p> <p>I plunked my tray on the table and mumbled a hi to everyone.</p> <p>Rosalie and I began a conversation when the cafeteria door banged open.</p> <p>Loudly.</p> <p>I glanced up. Wtf??? What was Jacob doing here?</p> <p>He marched up to our table.</p> <p>"Can I speak to you outside?" Jake asked, through clenched teeth.</p> <p>We got up and walked outside.</p> <p>That's when Jacob exploded.</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>"BELLA? YOU TRIED TO KILL KATHERINE WITH YOUR CAR?!?! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?" yelled the werewolf.</p> <p>"How did you find out about this?" I interrupted.</p> <p>"Duh Edward. Kat's in a pack. Jacob's also in that pack. Katherine almost got killed. How wouldn't he know about it???" said Rosalie.</p> <p>Then Jacob began to go on and on again at Bella.</p> <p>"JAKE STOP! Geez, calm your nerves. If you phase in a school with a lot of people watching you Sam would blow up like a volcano," Katherine said.</p> <p>"Yeah listen to the b*tch," I said, smirking.</p> <p>"Stay out of this leech!" she yelled.</p> <p>"Why should I?"</p> <p>"Because I said so."</p> <p>"And?"</p> <p>"You are so annoying! Just shut up and stay out of my life!!!" she shouted.</p> <p>"You came into my life you witch! It's not my fault you didn't get killed with your parents although sometimes I wish you did," I snarled at her.</p> <p>Immediately, I knew I went to far. If Kat didn't have a comeback in one second, something was wrong. I felt the anger leave my face.</p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>Woah. He did not just say that. I saw his face soften, as though he realized what he just said.</p> <p>As much as he hates me, Edward knows talking about my parents can and will drive me to tears. I saw his face soften, as though he realized what he just said.</p> <p>But I didn't care.</p> <p>I lifted my foot and kicked him as hard as I could in his chest, putting all my anger into it.</p> <p>Yeah, I know, he's a vampire.</p> <p>But I kicked the douche so hard he actually stumbled. I got up in his face.</p> <p>"Never talk about my parents," I said, threateningly.</p> <p>Edward looked stunned.</p> <p>I couldn't keep it in anymore. The tears began to flow.</p> <p>I tried to turn away before Edward saw them but he did.</p> <p>I ran into the forest and didn't stop. I didn't even know where I was going.</p> <p>"Leave her," I heard Rose say faintly, since I was so far by now.</p> <p>Jacob had tried to go after me, but Rose stopped him.</p> <p>Good. I love Jacob but right now I really didn't want anyone around.</p> <p>I stopped at the edge of a cliff. I wasn't going to commit suicide.</p> <p>I just stared out over the sea. I was probably miles away from the school if I could see the ocean.</p> <p>A crackling noise was made behind me.</p> <p>I spun around.</p> <p>I quickly walked away from the cliff.</p> <p>Whoever it was, I didn't want to make it as easy for them to kill me by just shoving me off the cliff.</p> <p>Something white flashed by.</p> <p>A vampire?</p> <p>Probably.</p> <p>My tears were still on my face. Great way to start a fight.</p> <p>The Thing flashed by again.</p> <p>This time a saw a flash of...red hair?<p><strong>Hi everybody. Please comment or vote or become a fan or something pleeeaaassee. But I will keep</strong></p> <p><strong> uploading cuz I know somewhere out there there is someone reading who doesn't have a account</strong></p> <p><strong> so yah hope you like my story :)</strong></p> <p></p> <p><strong>Oh geez I sound so desperate asking for comments or votes, shoot me now.</strong></p> <p><strong>Biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii =D</strong><p><strong>The pic is Victoria btw.</strong></p> <p><strong>_____________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I stepped even further away from the cliff.</p> <p>What was going on??? Red hair? I wasn't going crazy I knew that.</p> <p>A stick broke. I spun in that direction.</p> <p>"Well, well, well. A werewolf without her pack. What could be more vulnerable?" A female voice said.</p> <p>I turned around. A redhead stood in front of me.</p> <p>Wait, I knew her......Victoria?</p> <p>"What the hell do you want?" I asked. I was scared but I wasn't going to show it.</p> <p>Well, not to her anyway.</p> <p>"I want you out," she stated.</p> <p>"Out?"</p> <p>"Out of the way. You know the people who killed James. My James! And I'm killing them all, starting wtih you," she shrieked.</p> <p>Why me??? Why is it always me?</p> <p>"Let's see you try," I said.</p> <p>Victoria lunged at me. I dashed to the side and scaled up a tree.</p> <p>I broke off a whole branch and flung it at her.</p> <p>She dodged and leapt up at me.</p> <p>Yea, she didn't climb up. She jumped. <em>From the ground</em><em>.</em></p> <p>I went even higher up the tree.</p> <p>She followed me. Suddenly, Victoria's ice cold grip was on my ankle.</p> <p>It was so tight. I actually felt my blood circulation stop.</p> <p>I pulled my foot as hard as I could. How could she be so strong???</p> <p>I yanked my foot away and jumped to the ground.</p> <p>The was actually a deep scratch on my ankle.</p> <p>The minute my feet touched the ground, I began to run for dear life.</p> <p>Using my werewolf speed though.</p> <p>Victoria had a confused look on her face when I glanced back at her. Oh right. I wasn't supposed to be able to run without being in werewolf form, according to her.</p> <p>Oh well.</p> <p>In about ten seconds I was at the Cullens house. I ran in the door and dropped to the ground, so tired I could barely speak. My scratch had healed while I was running.</p> <p>I lay there panting.</p> <p>"What happened to you?" Jasper asked.</p> <p>He and Alice were sitting on the couch watching TV.</p> <p>I explained everything but I was breathing so heavily they probably didn't understand a word I was saying.</p> <p>"O-ok then. So you're saying that Victoria is gonna kill us all?" asked Alice.</p> <p>"Not if we kill her first," said Jasper.</p> <p>I heard someone coming down the stairs. Maybe it was Carlisle.</p> <p>Then Alice and Jasper or I could tell him and he's make everything ok again. :)</p> <p>I looked up. No.</p> <p>NO.</p> <p>It was Edward.</p> <p>I got up and walked outside. I heard footsteps behind me.</p> <p>Hopefully it was Emmett. I could really use some laughs right now.<p><strong>That's the pic of the meadow over there. Hope you like it :)</strong></p> <p><strong>_____________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I woke up to birds chirping in my ear and sunlight streaming through the windows.</p> <p>Not.</p> <p>That never happens and if it did I don't want it to happen to me. Ever.</p> <p>I went to the bathroom, did my stuff and pulled on some clothes. I had to see Carlisle and Esme. And the best part?</p> <p>NO MORE SCHOOL!!!!!! We were on vacation for two months. That's probably why the pack chose to leave now.</p> <p>Today was Saturday and tomorrow would be Sunday then vacation would officially be started.</p> <p>I didn't walk through the forest as I would usually do when I was at the pack's house and going to see the Cullens.</p> <p>I was too scared.</p> <p>Running to their house I looked around and there seemed to be something different about everything. I felt free. I hadn't felt that in a long time.</p> <p>Soon the Cullens' house became visible. I ran up the stairs and went in.</p> <p>I never knocked. They were so used to seeing me that whenever I knocked they knew it was me so I didn't bother to do it anymore.</p> <p>They didn't mind. They were like family to me.</p> <p>"Carlisle? Esme? Can I talk to you guys?" I called, since there was no one in the living room.</p> <p>"Of course, Katherine. What's up?" asked Esme, appearing out of nowhere with Carlisle at her side.</p> <p>I told them about the pack leaving and if I could stay here with them because I was too scared to stay there by myself.</p> <p>Not much scared me, but Victoria and The Volturi did.</p> <p>"I'm surprised you thought you had to ask. You're always welcome here Kat," said Carlisle smiling.</p> <p>"Thanks," I said relieved. If they had said no I might as well go crawl in a hole.</p> <p>I said I was going up to see the others and went over to Rosalie's room.</p> <p>Before I even knocked on the door she had it opened and yanked me in.</p> <p>"I heard everything! I can't believe you're staying with us!!! I'm so happy! All the pranks we could pull on everyone. My best friend is staying with us for two months. What the hell could be better???" she yelled/shouted/squealed.</p> <p>I laughed and we began to talk about practically everything.</p> <p>After a while, Rose and I went over to Alice's room so we could plan out our entire vacation.</p> <p>Alice heard me talking to Carlisle and Esme and she had a vision of us coming to her room.</p> <p>That girl.</p> <p>We planned out everything. And I made them come with me to the beach. It was always overcast here so they could go in the water like normal people.</p> <p>Emmett and Jasper said they would come too when I asked them. In fact everyone said yes.</p> <p>I didn't ask Edward. Rose said she would do that. I don't even want him to come but it would look bad if we had everyone going to the beach and Edward wasn't invited.</p> <p>And if he was coming, so was Bella. Unfortunately. She might sit on my head and keep me underwater for ten minutes and then when I was dead claim it was an accident.</p> <p>We continued to talk about vacation then the converstaion turned to Edward about the pranks we could pull on him.</p> <p>This vacation was going to be<em> very</em> funny.</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>Why, why, why??? The witch was going to stay with us. I heard her talking to Carlisle and Esme.</p> <p>Why in heaven's name would they say yes?</p> <p>Why must my vacation be ruined? By her?</p> <p>On second thought, this might not be so bad. The tricks I could pull on her. </p> <p>Thought began to run around in my mind about pranks to pull on her.</p> <p>I should write these down.</p> <p>I didn't bother because knowing Katherine, she might find the list and use it for me.</p> <p>I decided I would go for a run. I opened the window and jumped.</p> <p>No hunting, just running. Straight.</p> <p>Anything that was in my way I jumped over it. Soon, after about fifteen minutes, I came to this meadow.</p> <p>Never found this place before. It was like a large open field with a tree at one end.</p> <p>No flowers, just green grass and a few rocks here and there that you could sit on.</p> <p>I liked it. It calmed my nerves.</p> <p>I lay down. Today for a change it was actually sunny. </p> <p>My skin sparkled. It looked pretty, but just a disguise. To hide the monster.</p> <p>I wouldn't tell anyone about this place. Not even Bella.</p> <p>Especially not Bella.</p> <p>I liked her but I just wanted this place to be for me. No one else.</p> <p>Yeah, kinda selfish but to hell with that.</p> <p>An hour or two passed before it began to get dark and rain began to fall.</p> <p>I ran home and changed my clothes.</p> <p>I sat myself down on the couch and pulled out my book, The Lost City of Atlantis.</p> <p>The original copy. That book was really hard to find.</p> <p>I read and read, while listening to some music.</p> <p>When you can't sleep, it's actually a chore to find something to do.<p><strong>That's Katherine's bathing suit on the other side.</strong></p> <p><strong>_______________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I woke up feeling really tired. Oh right, I'll just blame Alice and Rose for that.</p> <p>Those two kept me up all night and since they can't sleep they totally forgot about me and planned out our whole vacation.</p> <p>I fell asleep in the middle of it so who knows what's gonna happen today.</p> <p>I made myself look and smell presentable then went downstairs. Rosalie and Alice stood at the counter arguing about something.</p> <p>From what I heard, they were arguing using whole wheat bread or white bread. Esme and Carlisle was out hunting so they had to make breakfast for me apparently. "Hey guys," I said, interrupting them.</p> <p>"Kat which one do you prefer, wheat bread or white bread?" Alice asked with her hands on her hips.</p> <p>"I told you it was wheat bread!" Rosalie said.</p> <p>"Actually I like both of them," I said nervously. That was a lie though. I actually prefered whole wheat but I would eat the white. It tastes good too.</p> <p>They stood there looking confused.</p> <p>"You know, I could make breakfast for myself," I said, trying to squeeze past them to the counter.</p> <p>Alice gave me a push back to where I was before.</p> <p>"No, no, no. This is the first time we get to use the kitchen so we're making it. Sit down!"</p> <p>I obediently sat down on the couch.</p> <p>After watching them discover how to crack and egg, it was pretty funny, I turned on the TV.</p> <p>Ooooo Lizzie Mcguire. Haven't seen that for a while. Good old Disney shows instead of those stupid shows like Shake It Up.</p> <p>That show has terrible actors if you ask me.</p> <p>Suddenly Rose and Alice and plunked a egg sandwich in front of me, looking rather proud of themselves.</p> <p>I stifled a giggle at their faces.</p> <p>"Thanks," I said gratefully and took a bite. It tasted really good though.</p> <p>Then I looked at it and realized that one side was white bread and the other side whole wheat.</p> <p>I laughed and continued eating. I was actually sad when it was done.</p> <p>"So, now that you're done eating the most delicious sandwich ever made, we're going to the beach!" Alice said jumping up.</p> <p>"Really?" I asked.</p> <p>"Duh. Weren't you listening last night?" said Rose.</p> <p>"I kinda fell asleep," I admitted.</p> <p>"Huh."</p> <p>"So go get your stuff. We're leaving in half and hour," said Alice.</p> <p>I washed my plate and went upstairs to pack my bag.</p> <p>"Kat? Can you come for a second?" called Rose.</p> <p>" Sure," I said and set down my bag and went to her room.</p> <p>"What do I need?"</p> <p>I laughed.</p> <p>"Shut up! I never went before, how would I know?"</p> <p>I kept laughing but told her.</p> <p>"A towel, a change of clothes, deoderant and whatever else you use and sunscreen," I listed.</p> <p>She put her hands on her hips and stared at me.</p> <p>"Oh sorry. Forget the sunscreen," I murmured.</p> <p>Rosalie laughed then pushed me out her room.</p> <p>Shaking my head, I went back to my room and packed the rest of the stuff I would need.</p> <p>I changed into my swim suit and pulled a purple tank top and shorts over it. I put my hair in a plait so it would stay out of the way.</p> <p>When I went downstairs Emmett, Jasper, Edward and Bella were there.</p> <p>Ew. Edward alone coming was bad enough but the idiot brought Thing Number One to join us.</p> <p>Rose and Alice came down a second later.</p> <p>"We're going to the beach! Hooray!" yelled Emmett, dancing around with a bouquet of red roses.</p> <p>Oh my gosh, what did he drink???</p> <p>"Excuse my husband, he seems to have taken the mind of a two year old," said Rose, shaking her head at him.</p> <p>Emmett walked over, gave her the roses and kissed her on the cheek.</p> <p>Rosalie smiled and thanked him.</p> <p>His face suddenly looked as though he was a little boy seeing Santa Claus.</p> <p>We laughed walked outside to Edward's car.</p> <p>Yay! I hated Edward but he drove so fast that your hair literally made one long line behind you.</p> <p>He started driving really fast, as usual. I wet my hand with a bottle of water I brought just for this and stuck it out the window.</p> <p>Oooooo that felt good. So cold and nice. :D</p> <p>"Edward slow down!" Bella whined.</p> <p>"Calm down Bella you're not gonna die," said Emmett, with a kinda pissed look on his face. We all loved it when Edward drove fast. He drove even faster than me.</p> <p>Still, Edward slowed down. Uuuuuggghhhhhhh.</p> <p>"Thank you," said Bella.</p> <p>He just nodded with a small smile on his face but his eyes had a pissed look in them. Guess he likes it when he drives fast too.</p> <p>Soon we were at the beach. It was overcast and it was completely empty. Not a single person was there.</p> <p>We came out and walked over to the sand.</p> <p>Bella and I spread our towels on the sand and sat on it. Everyone took one glance and followed us.</p> <p>Oh right, they never came to the beach before. Ha, it was funny how they didn't know what to do.</p> <p>"Yeah so you just take off your clothes and go into the water wearing your bathing suit when you're ready," I said, awkwardly.</p> <p>It was weird telling someone what you do when you're at the beach.</p> <p>"We were supposed to bring a bathing suit?!?!" yelled Emmett, looking really surprised.</p> <p>Rose pulled something out of her bag and flung it at him.</p> <p>"I knew you'd forget so I brought an extra one for you," she told him.</p> <p>"Oh thanks," said Emmett, looking relieved. He went in the changing room and put it on while we just stood outside waiting for him.</p> <p>When he came out we went in the water. Although Alice needed a little push from Jasper.</p> <p>We splashed each other and spent about four hours there before leaving.</p> <p>It was a lot of fun. Even though Edward and Bella was there.</p> <p>Vampires went to the beach. Huh. Weird but that was the Cullens for ya.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>When I woke up something felt different. Oh yeah...</p> <p>TODAY'S MY BIRTHDAY! :D I am now seventeen. HOORAY!</p> <p>I ran downstairs, still in my pajamas, and ran all over the house screaming that it was my birthday over and over.</p> <p>Until someone opened the door and I ran face first into it. </p> <p>"Geez girl we all know that today is the big day!" yelled Emmett, picking me and swinging me around then he went to the window and threw me out.</p> <p>I screamed, like any normal person, until someone else caught me. Alice. She yelled happy birthday to me and flung me in the air.</p> <p>Jasper caught me and he yelled happy birthday and it kinda kept going like that again and again except Rose, Carlisle and Esme joined in.</p> <p>Edward wasn't there. Could it get better?!</p> <p>Emmett had me now and he set me down, saying it was time for me to eat then open presents.</p> <p>Yay!!!! I love presents. I ran upstairs and changed my clothes then I went to the kitchen.</p> <p>I ate pancakes, eggs and bacon. That tasted so good. I put my plate in the dishwasher and walked into the living room, which you could barely see.</p> <p>There were balloons <em>everywhere. </em>I looked around and ran straight into them.</p> <p>Laughing, I fell down and kicked them up in the air. Yeah I'm kinda like a three year old on this day.</p> <p>Someone grabbed my arm and yanked me up. It was Jasper. He put me on his back and ran outside.</p> <p>Everyone was there. Even Edward. Oh poo. The only way he could entertain me is if he dropped to the ground and died. Bella was there too.</p> <p>Oh come on! It's my birthday! What's she doing here???</p> <p>Jasper set me down and I grinned at everybody. Alice and Rose grabbed my arm and dragged me into the forest.</p> <p>"This present is from us by the way," called Carlisle and Esme.</p> <p>"Thanks!" I yelled back. A stable came into sight. A stable?</p> <p>Esme pushed me inside. "Go to stall fourteen," she said.</p> <p>I looked for it and in it was a jet black horse. I have wanted a horse for soooo long.</p> <p>I screamed and jumped up and down like an idiot and hugged Carlisle and Esme thanking them over and over again.</p> <p>"And, you get to name it. It's a him. One of the fastest horses in the world," said Carlisle.</p> <p>I looked at the horse. "I'll call him.....Thunder."</p> <p>I patted the horse then Alice and Jasper pulled me away.</p> <p>"This one's from us," Alice said.</p> <p>There was a huge box. I looked inside and saw the most amazing thing ever. Bubble wrap! I pulled it out and sat on the floor popping the bubbles.</p> <p>"Look at what's inside the box Kat!" said Jasper.</p> <p>Oh right. I peeped in and there was something I've wanted ever since I saw Narnia. A bow and arrow! Alice pulled out a target and ran some distance away and stuck it in.</p> <p>She came back in two seconds (vampire speed) and told me to shoot. I took aim and fired. The arrown went straight in the middle.</p> <p>Like a boss.  :D</p> <p>Then Rose and Emmett walked over with a gift wrapped box. Ooo I love tearing the paper.</p> <p>"We went in Paris to get this, just saying," said Emmett.</p> <p>I sat down on the ground and tore it open. Black leather boots and short black fingerless leather gloves.</p> <p>I have wanted these things forever. I jumped up and hugged them tight.</p> <p>Then Bella walked over. I don't like the girl but hey, she bought me a present!</p> <p>I looked in the gift bag she gave me. Omg. A silver necklace with a ballerina pendent. </p> <p>"Oh my gosh. Thank you Bella. It's gorgeous," staring at the thing in awe before putting it on.</p> <p>She mumbled something that sounded like 'your welcome' and went back at Edward's side. Then Edward walked over and handed me a wrapped present.</p> <p>I said thanks and opened it. My eyes nearly dropped out of my head. It was a book. The original book.</p> <p>The Lost City of Atlantis.</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>Yeah I know what you're thinking. I just gave her any old thing from home. Well number one: I know for a fact that Katherine has wanted it for forever.</p> <p>And number two: I figured she would like it more than I did.</p> <p>Kat's eyes looked as though they would fall out.</p> <p>"Edward----" her voice faltered, "Thank you," she whispered.</p> <p>Kat walked over and <em>hugged</em> me. She would never do that but I gave her the one thing she wanted more than anything so I just hugged her back.</p> <p>I touched her. Ugh. I'll have to boil myself now. She didn't like it either. I read her mind when she opened it.</p> <p>"Omg Omg Omg. Well, I'd better hug him too. Ew. Ew. Ew. Ew. Aggghhhh I'm touching him. I'll have to live in the shower for the rest of my life."</p> <p>It was pretty funny. Alice jumped up and annouced that it was time for cake.</p> <p>She bought a cake??? I sighed. I pulled Bella on to my back and everyone ran off back home.</p> <p>It was chocolate. Plain chocolate. None of that icing or frosting. Thank goodness. I could eat some for politness' sake without spitting it out.</p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>Edward Cullen gave me The Lost City of Atlantis. I could die right now. No...I would wait till I finished the book.</p> <p>And I had to touch him. Eeeeeeew. Well I didn't have to but he gave me a really good gift. I couldn't just mumble thanks. </p> <p>We had cake and ice cream. Ben and Jerry's Phish Food. I loved that one but it was really expensive, well for me, so I never had it that often.</p> <p>And there <em>twenty</em> pints. Two for today and the rest was mine. Turning seventeen is goood.</p> <p>After a while Bella left and I went up to my bedroom. I stayed till about ten reading the book when it began to rain.</p> <p>I pulled on a hoodie and jumped out the window and went to my secret place.</p> <p>I just sat there and let myself get soaked until it stopped raining. It gave me time to think. </p> <p>To imagine.</p> <p>To <em>dream.</em></p> <p>I wasn't worried about Victoria finding me. That's the reason it was a secret place. I went back to my room when it stopped raining and had a hot shower, changed my clothes and lay down in my bed.</p> <p>When it was 12:01 a.m. I would go to sleep. Then my birthday would officially be over.</p> <p>Unfortunately I fell asleep at midnight. Oh well.</p> <p>This would have to be the best birthday I've had. Ever. Usually I spent half the day with the pack and the other half with the Cullens.</p> <p>But then again, it was the first time I spent my <em>entire</em> birthday with the Cullens.</p> <p><p><strong>That's their kitchen over there. I love it =D</strong></p> <p><strong>_______________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I woke up this morning. On the ground. Hm...either I went to sleep on the ground or I fell out of the bed.</p> <p>I think it's the second one. I went in the bathroom, did my stuff and went downstairs.</p> <p>Everyone was there. I greeted everyone and they responded.</p> <p>"Hey Kat? Well we're going to be gone, but just for today," said Esme.</p> <p>"Why?" I asked, while munching on some toast Esme made for me.</p> <p>"Well, Jasper and Alice want some time alone, Rose and Emmett are going out to hunt and Carlisle and I are going to my island to check up on things there and you'll be alone...with Edward," said Esme.</p> <p>I blinked. "Isn't Edward going to be with Bella or something???" I asked, my voice becoming kinda shrill.</p> <p>"Bella, is out of town, visiting her mother for today," said Edward.</p> <p>I blinked. And again. And again. But I didn't argue or make a fuss. After all, I still was their guest. But that doesn't mean I wasn't pissed about staying with world's biggest douchebag.</p> <p>"O--kay," I said.</p> <p>"Thanks. We had hoped you would be ok with it," said Alice.</p> <p>"Of course. So go and have fun and hunt and check up on things and who knows what else," I said laughingly.</p> <p>They said bye and in a flash they were gone. I finished my toast and washed the plate. Edward had gone up to his room. Thank goodness.</p> <p>I took out the book he gave me, kicked back on the couch and began reading.</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>Great. I'm gonna be stuck with that witch for the day. Ok Ed, it's just a day. I could survive this.</p> <p>I sat on the couch and began working on the piece of music I had thought of some night ago. After a while I had almost finished it.</p> <p>It took three hours. I wanted it perfect. I only had to do one more bar and it would be done.</p> <p>I played the piano for so long that I knew what every note sounded like. I didn't even need the piano to do a song.</p> <p>I went downstairs to find the wicked witch of the west crawling on the floor. This girl.</p> <p>"What are you doing???"</p> <p>I had to ask. Who wouldn't if you saw someone crawling around on the floor?</p> <p>"I'm hungry," Kat said.</p> <p>I nodded and walked off. I didn't know what that had to do with her crawling on the floor but to ask Katherine would be like nailing jello to a tree.</p> <p>"Edward..... make me something to eat," she begged.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Edwaaaaaard."</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"......Please," she said.</p> <p>That made me turn around. I raised an eyebrow at her. "No." Even though she said please. Which she never says. To me.</p> <p>"Just cook something," I said.</p> <p>"You know that I am the only person in the world who can burn water," Katherine said.</p> <p>True though. She was a terrible cook. She was never good at the things girls should be good at.</p> <p>Kat couldn't sew a straight stitch to save her life.</p> <p>"Well order in then."</p> <p>"I--I can't," she said.</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>"I don't like to talk to them. I always forget the address and end up hanging up on them."</p> <p>I started laughing. I couldn't help it.</p> <p>"Shut up! It's not funny," Kat mumbled, blushing and staring at the ground.</p> <p>"It is and I'm still not making you something to eat. Starve," I told her.</p> <p>We don't have anything in the fridge already cooked. No leftovers or anything cause we don't eat.</p> <p>"Fine," she huffed.</p> <p>Good. Maybe she'll leave me alone now. I walked up to my room. The minute I closed my door she began yelling. Right outside the door.</p> <p>"Edward pleeaaaaaase. I'm starving. Please. Please with blood on top," she bawled.</p> <p>Urrrgggghhhh. Might as well shut her up.</p> <p>I opened the door. Kat had her back on the ground and was scraping her feet all over the wall.</p> <p>"Fine! Just leave me alone!" I yelled.</p> <p>"Ok!" she said, a huge grin coming on her face.</p> <p>I stomped into the kitchen and made her barbecue and fries. Maybe that will keep the wolf alive until the others come back. </p> <p>The whole time Kat just stared at me while I was cooking in awe. Her eyes were wide open. Guess this would be interesting for someone who had no clue on how to cook.</p> <p>Granted, I was a great cook. I put the plate in front of her and walked off.</p> <p>"Edwaaaaaaaaaaaard," she called.</p> <p>AAAAAGGGGGHHHHHHH. "What?!" I yelled back.</p> <p>".....Thank you," she whispered. If I wasn't a vampire I couldn't have heard it.</p> <p>"Your welcome," I called. I went up to my room and stayed there until Alice and all of them came back.</p> <p>I didn't even go downstairs to see them. I saw them for over one hundred years so no point.</p> <p>I just stayed in my room and played the piece of music over and over in my head. It sounded really good.</p> <p>All I had to do now was to <em>finish </em>it.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I got up, did my usual and went downstairs. I ate, then everyone sat down and we played cards.</p> <p>Which was completely unfair because Alice kept predicting what we would do and she ended up winning every single time.</p> <p>Carlisle and Esme walked in with worried looks on their faces.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" asked Rose.</p> <p>"Victoria. We got a letter through the mail requesting us to come to the forest to have a chat with her," said Carlisle.</p> <p>"No don't go!" I yelled. It was a trap. Maybe. Possibly. I don't know! I just didn't want them to go.</p> <p>"Don't worry we'll be very careful. We should at least go see what she wants," said Esme.</p> <p>I sighed. I didn't push it. "Ok. So when do you have to go?"</p> <p>"Now."</p> <p>In a blink they were gone. I sat down and fussed with my cards.</p> <p>"Kat don't worry. They'll be fine. They are vampires you know," said Emmett, grinning.</p> <p>I made myself happy and we kept playing. An hour later they were back.</p> <p>Carlisle and Esme sat down and told us what they wanted. Edward and Bella were over here too. Unfortunately.</p> <p>Apparently, Victoria wanted us to leave. Leave Forks, the house, everything. If not, a fight would take place. In the forest. At midnight.</p> <p>"But why does she want us gone?" asked Jasper.</p> <p>"She hates us for killing James and she claimed she doesn't want to kill us so we have a choice, die or leave. I think she knows that she can't kill us. Not on her own anyway," said Esme.</p> <p>"Well we fight. We can't leave. Well, we could but I don't want to," said Emmett.</p> <p>"But here's the thing. Victoria has the scent of blood all over her. There was a boy with her too. She turned humans into vampires, I believe, and practically built an army to take us down," said Carlisle.</p> <p>"So even if we moved, she would track us down and kill us anyway," said Alice quietly.</p> <p>"We don't know how much vampires she has. No doubt she made more than us," said Esme.</p> <p>"Yeah, but they would be newborns. They would be bloodthirsty and barely know how to fight wouldn't they?" asked Edward.</p> <p>"That's probably why the fight is tonight. They are newborns, wild and crazy. Ready to fight."</p> <p>"But we don't have enough people to take them down. If we do it on our own, there's a chance one of us might not be here afterwards," said Rose.</p> <p>There was silence. No one spoke.</p> <p>"Maybe, just maybe, I could get the pack to come?" I said. I wasn't sure but to hell with that.</p> <p>"You think so?" asked Esme. looking relieved.</p> <p>"Yeah, they could came back and then go back to The Bahamas afterwards," I said.</p> <p>"I'll go ask now."</p> <p>I put in a long distance call to Sam. He had given me their hotel number, just in case.</p> <p>When he answered, I told him everything and after about fifteen minutes of pleading he said they could. Thank goodness.</p> <p>"The pack could come," I announced.</p> <p>"We could all go then," said Edward.</p> <p>"No Edward! You can't go. I might lose you," said Bella.</p> <p>"Bella I have to. It's my family."</p> <p>"Well, can I come watch?" she asked.</p> <p>What is she retarded?!?!?! She wants to come <em>watch?.</em> They're vampires. They could pick up a scent even if she were a mile away.</p> <p>"Bella, no. It's too dangerous. They could smell you and you might get hurt," said Edward.</p> <p>"Jacob, he showed me a way to disguise my scent. You get a certain scented herb and rub it all over you. You smell just like the forest then," said Bella.</p> <p>Edward looked at Carlisle. Carlisle sighed and nodded. "Okay you can come."</p> <p>"But, you have to stay high up in a tree where they can't see you and under NO circumstances are you to come out unless we call you, understand?" said Edward.</p> <p>Bella nodded happily. What is wrong with her??? It's a fight, not a football game. Anyway, the pack would be here at ten.</p> <p>It was the earliest flight they could get. </p> <p>We went outside and trained until it was eleven. I was starting to get worried. The pack wasn't here yet.</p> <p>Bella was in the tree since ten. It was half eleven now. Where was Sam?!?! He promised.</p> <p>"Katherine? Where is the pack?" asked Jasper.</p> <p>"I--I don't know," I said looking through the window, just hoping to see the car.</p> <p>"Well we have to go now. It's quarter to eleven," said Carlisle.</p> <p>"But there's a huge possibility we might be outnumbered!" I yelled.</p> <p>"We'll have to take that chance."</p> <p>"I'm sorry everyone. They didn't come. I'm so sorry," I said. looking down.</p> <p>"Oh Kat, it's not your fault." said Esme hugging me.</p> <p>"Let's go." We ran into the woods. Alice managed to get Bella to keep a simple dress up in the tree for me so after the fight I wouldn't be stark naked.</p> <p>We arrived at the place in the forest. Victoria and the boy, Riley, was there already.</p> <p>"Hmm...just you? This should be easy," said Victoria smirking.</p> <p>As if on cue, a bunch of vampires were behind her. A whole lot more than we bargained for.</p> <p>Guess, this is it. Please let us all be here after, I sliently prayed.</p> <p>Suddenly I heard a growl behind me. The entire Cullen Coven turned around.</p> <p>Sam and the pack was there. Tall and strong and looking at Victoria with such hatred I wanted to drop to my knees.</p> <p>Jacob's wolf came up and nudged my hand. I looked at him.</p> <p>"Good luck," he said in his mind. I mouthed "you too" back at him. I phased and both sides began running towards each other.</p> <p>The battle had begun.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I ran full speed toward the vampires. I was excited. Not scared. At all. Never.</p> <p>Well, maybe a little bit. I attacked the first one that came at me. </p> <p>I tore of her head and flung it in the woods and did that to her arms and legs as well.</p> <p>The battle continued like that for a while. Everyone was still there, thank goodness. I finished off the dude who came at me and looked around.</p> <p>The place was almost empty. Not much were left and the pack and the Cullens were taking care of them.</p> <p>I looked for everyone. Edward was fighting eight vampires at the same time. Scary.</p> <p>Victoria was sneaking up behind him. Oh crap. He was really vulnerable right now. Edward was a douche, but I couldn't let him die.</p> <p>Maybe I could, but I didn't hate him <em>that</em> much.</p> <p>I ran towards Victoria. And I saw someone jump out from the tree.</p> <p>AAGGGHHH. Bella!!! Why??? Apparently she was going to attack Victoria because she didn't want Edward to get hurt.</p> <p>Idiot human. She wasn't supernatural. Unfortunately, she didn't hit her target. She dropped on me.</p> <p>No, no, no!!! I tried to fling Bella off me but she was like a vice grip. I was going to surprise Victoria. Victoria was more experienced and surprise would have been my only advantage.</p> <p>With one last heave I flung Bella off. Too late. Victoria had seen me already.</p> <p>When I had thrown off Bella, I had to use so much force I actually ended up backwards. But I didn't turn around fast enough.</p> <p>Cold arms wrapped around me. I twisted and squirmed. Victoria had me.</p> <p>I clawed at her face but she wouldn't let go. I moved in every way the human body allowed.</p> <p>Then the arms got tighter. I screamed for help in my mind but the pack was fighting.</p> <p>With one swift tighten, I heard all of my bones cracking.</p> <p>Like huge trees, falling down at the same time, and the roots ripping out of the ground.</p> <p>The pain was terrible. Victoria wouldn't let go still. I could barely move. I was like a pile of flesh.</p> <p>She tightened her grip and more bones cracked. I howled.</p> <p>The loudest, most pain-filled howl I ever did. I heard Victoria laugh, then drop me.</p> <p>I fell to the ground, hurting like crazy and still howling. The remainder or newborns ran away with Victoria.</p> <p>Alice and Rose ran up to me. My vision was blurry. I saw them grab my dress.</p> <p>I phased and it hurt even more. They covered me with the dress. I couldn't take the pain anymore.</p> <p>I didn't want to feel it anymore. God had mercy on me, because right then, I blacked out.</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>I remember I was fighting about seven or eight vampires. They were easy to kill, since they had absolutely no experience.</p> <p>Then I heard this howl. I dropped to my knees, holding my ears.</p> <p>I looked around for where the sound was coming from. Whoever it was was in serious pain. It actually hurt me hearing it.</p> <p>Katherine. Victoria managed to get hold of her and broke almost all of her bones.</p> <p>But I don't get that. Kat was a really good fighter.</p> <p>How could Victoria even manage to touch her in first place?</p> <p>Alice and Rosalie ran over and covered her with the dress after she phased. Where was Bella?</p> <p>I looked around and saw her sitting down under the tree. I went up to her.</p> <p>"Bella! You were supposed to stay in the tree!!! Why did you come out???" I wanted to shout but said calmy instead.</p> <p>"Edward! Victoria was going to attack you but I jumped on her before she could. Katherine got mad at me for coming out and flung me in the woods," she sobbed.</p> <p>What? Kat hurt Bella? Well, I wasn't helping her at all. I don't care if she was on her death bed.</p> <p>I took Bella into my arms and spoke to her soothingly. I picked her up and I ran home.</p> <p>I didn't even see if Katherine was okay. Why should I?</p> <p>After I put Bella in the guest room, I went downstairs. Everyone was there, even the pack, and they were around Kat.</p> <p>I saw Emmett pick her up and take her upstairs. Probably to the medical room Carlisle had.</p> <p>"Edward! Why did you run off??? Katherine was hurt. I know you don't like her but you could have at least stayed and made sure she was ok!" Alice cried.</p> <p>"Why should I? She flung Bella in the woods and could've killed her!" I yelled.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" asked Alice looking confused. I told her what Bella told me.</p> <p>"Edward that's impossible. I was keeping tabs on Kat. Katherine was going to attack Victoria and Bella jumped out from the tree to attack Victoria but landed on Kat," said Rose.</p> <p>"And Kat flung her off because Victoria was coming at her but it was too late and Victoria got ahold of her," said Jasper, picking up the story and ending it.</p> <p>What? Bella lied to me then? Why???</p> <p>I went upstairs to talk to Bella. I had to find out what was going on.</p> <p><p><strong>That's Katherine's dress over there. I loooooove it =D</strong></p> <p><strong>_______________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>When I woke up I was lying on a bed in a room that was completely white. I was wrapped in bandages. Everywhere hurt.</p> <p>Just then, the door opened and Carlisle walked in. I was glad to see him.</p> <p>"Hey Kat. How are you feeling?" he asked.</p> <p>"Fragile," I answered. So? It was true.</p> <p>He chuckled.</p> <p>"What happened?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Well after Victoria broke your bones,they started to heal, but in the same position. I had to break them again," he explained.</p> <p>AAAGGGGHHHH. That probably hurt. Good thing I was sleeping.</p> <p>"Did you catch Victoria?" I asked.</p> <p>"No," he said with a sigh," she and three other newborns got away."</p> <p>At least it was only three. "So when can I come out of this mummy suit?"</p> <p>"Right now, actually. I came in to unwrap you," he said, and began unwinding the bandages. Soon they were off.</p> <p>I stood up and felt myself. Nothing missing, that should be good. Carlisle told me to take it easy since some of my bones might still be a bit weak.</p> <p>I went downstairs. Yay! Emmett and and everyone else was there. I greeted them.</p> <p>"KAT!!! You're alive!!!" yelled Alice doing a happy dance all over. I laughed.</p> <p>"Katherine, did you hear what Bella said?" asked Jasper.</p> <p>"I don't know, I was too busy being unconscious," I answered.</p> <p>"Oh right. Well, she said she jumped out the tree to save Edward and you flung her into the woods on purpose so you could hurt her," explained Jasper.</p> <p>I let out a string of cuss words.</p> <p>"Woah, calm down," laughed Emmett.</p> <p>I soothed myself and asked what happened to her.</p> <p>"Edward's upstairs talking to her right now. We found out what she said because Edward told us the reason he just left you," said Rosalie.</p> <p>Woah. Edward just left? I hate him and I know he hates me but <em>I saved his life!</em> And he just leaves. Douchebag.</p> <p>"Oh well, let's play Monopoly," announced Jasper, with the Monopoly box suddenly in his hand.</p> <p>Ooooo I was really good at this game. Just go for Boardwalk and Park Place and you bankrupt everybody. We sat down and began to play</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>Well, Bella did lie to me. Her reason?</p> <p>"I didn't want you to get mad at me!" and she began to cry. I forgave her but I was still pissed.</p> <p>I went downstairs and Alice and the others were there, setting up Monopoly.</p> <p>"Edward!!! Come play! You could be the horse!" yelled Alice.</p> <p>I sighed. I hadn't played this in a long time, but I was awesome at it. I always bankrupted everyone. Boardwalk and Park Place.</p> <p>Hmm.....Kat was out of the medical room. I sat down and nodded to her. She looked away.</p> <p>Guess someone told her I left when she got hurt. Oh well.</p> <p>Everyone lost. Who won? Katherine. If I got Boardwalk and Park Place I would've won but noooo she had to go get it.</p> <p>I said I was going out for a little while. I stepped outside and ran to the forest.</p> <p>I was going to the meadow I had found. I needed to think. To sort some stuff out.</p> <p>Like why Bella lied to me. If she lied to me then, did she lie about losing control of the car? </p> <p>Was she <em>trying</em> to kill Katherine? If so, I'm proud of her. But still! Bella shouldn't do that.</p> <p>I sighed. Bella was changing all of a sudden. And I don't know why. I checked the time on my watch. I should get back.</p> <p>The pack was leaving and Alice decided she wanted to throw a party for them.</p> <p>Apparently, for Alice, any excuse to plan a party will do. I was home in two seconds. Alice had already hung balloons and decorated the place.</p> <p>It's what she does best. All the girls wore dresses. Alice a red, Rose a blue and Kat a black dress. Bella went home already.</p> <p>The pack came. Nasty smelling creatures but they did help us. They stayed for about one hour then they had to go to catch the flight back to the Bahamas.</p> <p>I went up to my room. I wanted to listen to a new CD I got. I plugged in the headphones and zoned out.</p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I thanked Sam and the pack for coming.</p> <p>"Anytime Katherine. The house ok? No one tried to break in?" he questioned.</p> <p>I reassured him and sent the pack off to the car. It was the last flight back to the Bahamas for the day and they couldn't miss it.</p> <p>I went up to my room, took off my dress and lay down on my bed carefully. I felt exhausted.</p> <p>Carlisle warned me I might be tired for the next two days and might still feel sore. He was right.</p> <p>I groaned and took off my light. It only ten and I was tired. That was really early.</p> <p>For me, anyways.</p> <p>I went to sleep, telling myself I'll feel better in the morning.</p> <p>I hoped that I would be right.<p><strong>That's Rose's balcony. Kat has one too, but not as big.</strong></p> <p><strong>_____________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I woke up the next morning. I got off my bed slowly.</p> <p>Good. I felt normal again. I made myself decent and went downstairs.</p> <p>The entire day went by normally. Except for Emmett.</p> <p>He decided he wanted to be like Avril Lavigne and ran around the house singing Girfriend.</p> <p>Thank goodness we were out of civilization. Sorry for the animals though.</p> <p>It was in the evening when I lay on the ground, bored. I went up to see Rosalie.</p> <p>She opened her door and let me in. We went and sat on the chairs on her balcony and talked for a while.</p> <p>I showed her the stars through the telescope. Rosalie had never used it before, but I knew a lot of the stars.</p> <p>I wanted to be an astronomer, but gave that up when I found out about the Bermuda Triangle. I pointed out Orion's Belt and Pegasus to her.</p> <p>"Katherine, I don't wanna make you sad or anything, but, what happened to your parents?" she asked.</p> <p>"Do you wanna know everything in my past or just that?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Everything," Rose said.</p> <p>I started. </p> <p>"Well, when I was younger, I was at home with my parents. I lived like a normal child. I never knew the pack, or knew that I was a werewolf."</p> <p>"My parents knew about werewolves though. They just didn't know if I would be one, since my dad was a werewolf but my mom was human, so they never said anything."</p> <p>"I was taking a walk in the forest in the night. I was fourteen. I remember it well. That night was a full moon. Werewolves don't need the full moon to shift, but the first time you're shifting, it always happens on a full moon."</p> <p>"I remember I fell to the ground, in so much pain, screaming like I don't know what."</p> <p>"Every single bone cracked out of its joint. God, Rose it hurt like crazy."</p> <p>"When I finally turned, I ran around and got the feel of things. The first two or three times you shift, it hurts a lot, but not as much as the first time."</p> <p>"After that I told my dad what happened and he explained everything to me. I was okay with it."</p> <p>I stopped. "What happened to your parents?" she asked me.</p> <p>I took a huge breath and started.</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>I just came home from Bella's. I had to leave before her dad came. Sadly.</p> <p>I was passing Rosalie's room when I heard her say to someone," What happened to your parents?"</p> <p>She was probably talking to Kat. Katherine never told anyone about what happened. And I hate her with every inch of my being, but I still wanted to know.</p> <p>Call me eavesdropper, but hey, I'm curious.</p> <p>She began.</p> <p>"I was at home, eating dinner with my parents. We talked as usual. I was an only child so I usually told my troubles to my parents."</p> <p>"After that we sat down and watched TV. In the middle of the show, the door burst open."</p> <p>"Five men came in with guns and knives. I was effing terrified. Two of them kept guns pointing at us and the others swept everything off the dining room table."</p> <p>"They grabbed my mother and and father and tied them down on the table."</p> <p>"My parents fought like crazy, but it was five against two. Four of the men stood at the table and each of them pulled out knives."</p> <p>"One of them stood behind me and held my head in their direction. The men lowered the knives to their skin."</p> <p>Katherine took a deep breath.</p> <p>"I was forced to watch my parents get chopped to death."</p> <p>"Before they left, I took a deep breath to get their scent and ran like the wind. Straight out the door and that's when I found the pack."</p> <p>"They took me in and took care of me. But I hunted down those men. And I killed them."</p> <p>I stopped listening. I couldn't hear anymore.</p> <p>Katherine was forced to watch her parents get killed.</p> <p>It must have been horrible. Oh hell, it <em>is </em>horrible.</p> <p>I felt sorry for her right now. No wonder Sam told us to be careful with her.</p> <p>Sometimes when she spent the night over here she would wake up screaming. I never went to find out why.</p> <p>I thought it was just some nightmare. Dear God, she was probably dreaming about this. I left and went up to my room.</p> <p>I sat down on the couch and thought about what happened to her for the entire night.</p> <p>Even if I was able to sleep, I knew I couldn't. I just thought about what she said.<p><strong>The video is what Kat played and sang on the piano. You all know what Edward played. If not, just type it in on youtube. The pic is the piano.</strong></p> <p><strong>______________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>The minute I woke up this morning I knew something was going to go wrong. And it wasn't because I fell out of my bed.</p> <p>I dressed and went downstairs. Seemed like they were waiting for me because everyone was gathered at the bottom of the staircase.</p> <p>"Hey, what's up?" I asked.</p> <p>"Kat, well, we're going hunting for a while but Edward is the only one gonna be home," said Rose, looking...I don't know...carefully.</p> <p>What?!?!?! Again! Geez,why why why?!?!?! Edward had a pissed off look on his face too.</p> <p>"Why isn't Edward going?" I wanted to scream but managed to say.</p> <p>"Two reasons, one, he had a, bit of an... overdose, last time he went hunting and two, we don't want you starving to death," said Emmett grinning at me.</p> <p>I screwed up my face at him.</p> <p>"Well, we're gonna go now, have fun!" said Esme and poof, they were gone.</p> <p>Edward and I sat down on the couch and didn't say a word. </p> <p>I didn't want to talk to him. But I was bored. Hmm....I'll explore. </p> <p>This house is huge and I still haven't seen the full thing. I know that because sometimes I get lost.</p> <p>I got up, walked upstairs and walked down some random hallway. I didn't say anything to Edward. Soon, I really was lost.</p> <p>Usually I find my way back, but this time everywhere looked different. I went into every room I saw.</p> <p>So far, it has eight guest bedrooms, three medical rooms, ten entertainment rooms, a theatre and who knows what else.</p> <p>I opened a door to another random room. The entire place was dark. I looked for a light switch but I couldn't find it.</p> <p>Or I was just too lazy too look properly. There was a single window with light shining on some gigantic object.</p> <p>I walked over to it. Ooooo it was a piano. In really good condition. Not even speck of dust. Jet black and really shiny.</p> <p>I sat down on the bench thing and lifted the cover. The keys were so white, they seemed to shine.</p> <p>When I was younger and lived with my parents, I took piano classes. I hated them because the teacher was mean, but I loved the piano. And he was a good teacher actually.</p> <p>We had to write a song for something in that class when the teacher got mad.</p> <p>I did the song but never got a chance to play it. I remembered all the notes though.</p> <p>I placed my fingers on the keys and began to play. There was a song too. </p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>I was sitting on the couch for a while, wondering where Kat had gone or if she got lost.</p> <p>I finally finished the piece of music. It came to me sometime last night.</p> <p>Suddenly, I heard this really nice music. It was calming, soothing. Played on the piano. Someone was singing too.</p> <p>It sounded so good that I actually got up to find where it was coming from.</p> <p>It didn't take long. I found the room and looked past the door.</p> <p>It was Katherine. I didn't know she played the piano.</p> <p>I just stood there and didn't say a word. I just listened to the music. I wonder who taught her.</p> <p>The music finished. I read her mind, just out of curiosity.</p> <p><em>Hmm...this piano is in really good shape. I wonder whose own is it...</em></p> <p>Apparently she saw my name written in gold on it because I heard:</p> <p><em>Oh crap. I never saw this piano in my life. I never came in this room. I fell, blacked out and when I woke up, I was here. Yup. Very believeable.</em></p> <p>I stepped inside the room. </p> <p>"It's ok," I said.</p> <p>"Really?" she asked, looking surprised.</p> <p>"Yes," I replied looking at her.</p> <p>Katherine seemed to relax. I don't know why I was doing it. I honestly didn't.</p> <p>But I sat down next to her. And began to play the song I wrote.</p> <p>(A/N This one is Bella's lullaby, just it's not for Bella!)</p> <p>In the middle of the song, she put her head on my shoulder. And I didn't push her away. It felt.....right.</p> <p>I wonder what she's thinking, I thought as the song came to an end.</p> <p><em>Hmm that was really good. I wish he'd play it again.</em></p> <p>I chuckled and started over.</p> <p><em>Weird, it's almost like he read my min--Edward.</em></p> <p>I chuckled again and kept playing. After the second time, she fell asleep. I picked her up and took her to her room.</p> <p>What? I couldn't leave her sleeping on the bench.</p> <p>She lay sleeping in her bed. I sat down on the bed and watched her. It fascinated me, people sleeping.</p> <p>What goes through their minds when they're sleeping? Is it just blank or something?</p> <p>I didn't know, so I read her mind.</p> <p>Weird. A lot of pictures coming up. Like videos, but they made absolutely no sense. Does everyone do this when they're sleeping????</p> <p>Ooooohhhh this is probably what they call dreams. They look like fun. I don't remember having them when I was human.</p> <p>Kat's dreams were interesting. They made no sense and yet, somehow they were believeable.</p> <p>I lay down on her bed, looking at her dreams. She talks in them too, but in her mind. Suddenly, Kat rolled over, and put her head on my chest.</p> <p>What the hell?? People move in their sleep?? Bella never did.</p> <p>She was talking in her mind.</p> <p><em>Something feels cold. So cold and nice. Aaaahhhh. Whatever this is, it's better than air-conditioning.</em></p> <p>What was she talking about? Oh right, me. Was I really that cold?</p> <p>For the whole night, I just lay there with her on my chest, looking at her dreams.</p> <p>It was like watching a video with nothing that could ever be real but seemed so believeable, and that was the best part.<p><strong>The pic over there is Katherine's....room thing. Idk what to call it. It's not a balcony but I'll just call it that :P And that's the song Edward played for her, cuz I know it has two versions. The one he played for her is this one :)</strong></p> <p><strong>____________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's</strong> <strong>POV</strong></p> <p>I remember feeling something nice and cold (and I love the cold) in my bed and snuggling up it.</p> <p>What I didn't remember was going to sleep with Edward Cullen in my bed. The minute I opened my eyes I saw him underneath me.</p> <p>I jumped up and fell flat on the floor. "What were you doing in my bed?!?!" I screamed at him.</p> <p>"You fell asleep while I was playing the piano so I took you up to your bed," he explained.</p> <p>"And what? You tripped and fell in the bed, got knocked out and when you woke up you were too tired to move?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, it's just, your dreams, they fascinated me. I...sort of....watched them while you were sleeping," he said sheepishly.</p> <p>"Dreams fascinate you?"</p> <p>"Yea I've never had them."</p> <p>"Sucks for you," I muttered.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Because dreams are your only escape from the logical world. And in the dream it feels as though it's real life," I said.</p> <p>"Sounds amazing," he said, staring into space.</p> <p>"Yeah, it is."</p> <p>"Buuuuut you need to go now," I said.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>I put my hands on my hips, cocked my head to one side and gave him a look that said, 'You're really asking that???'</p> <p>"Right. I'll go now," he said, getting up and leaving.</p> <p>I shut the door behind him and while I was taking a shower I thought about what he told me.</p> <p>Did he really not have dreams? That sucks. Big time.</p> <p>I rubbed in a huge handful of shampoo in my hair.</p> <p>But what if vampires lay down on a bed and closed their eyes? Wouldn't they fall asleep or something? What would they do if they got tired?</p> <p>Apparently, thinking in the shower does not work out for me, because I washed my hair six times absentmindedly.</p> <p>The shampoo bottle was halfway down. Great, I only just got that thing. I got out, changed my clothes and went downstairs.</p> <p>When I went downstairs, only Edward was there. I guess Rose and the others still hadn't got back.</p> <p>Edward was in the kitchen. I walked in, sat on the counter and watched him cook whatever he was cooking. Scrambled eggs and bacon. </p> <p>And it smelt <em>good.</em> Sweet Jesus, please tell me it was for me.</p> <p>"Who's that for?" I asked.</p> <p>He raised an eyebrow and looked at me. Great I feel really stupid right now.</p> <p>Who else would it be for Kat? "Right," I mumbled.</p> <p>He smirked and put the eggs and bacon in a plate and at that very moment the toast popped out of the toaster.</p> <p> "How'd you learn to cook so good. I mean, you don't eat," I asked, eating the bacon first.</p> <p>"Food Network," Edward replied grinning.</p> <p> "Hm."</p> <p>I finished and washed my plate. When I turned around Edward was staring at me with a weird look.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>"Who taught you how to play piano?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Well, this piano teacher dude taught me for a while, and he was really mean, but he could play the piano amazingly, so I put up with him," Katherine replied.</p> <p>"And how did you manage to get your hands on The Lost City Of Atlantis?" she asked me.</p> <p>Guess I better answer her.</p> <p>"I guess you know I came really far back right? In those days, that book was a new release. It was in every store. Alice bought me it for my birthday once and that's how I got it," I told her.</p> <p>"How old are you?"</p> <p>"One hundred and seven years old."</p> <p>"Grandpa," she muttered.</p> <p>I snickered. We sat on the couch and watched a movie. A horror. Saw. </p> <p>"Edward?" Kat called.</p> <p>"Hm?"</p> <p>"What is it like...when you...you know...feed?" she asked awkwardly.</p> <p>I laughed. "You never saw anyone of us feed?"</p> <p>"No! I don't stalk you," she said.</p> <p>"Tomorrow come at my room at eleven and I'll show you," I told her.</p> <p>"Ok!" she said, looking happy.</p> <p>I never understood why Kat could be happy for the strangest things.</p> <p>That's kinda odd. I had an actual conversation  with Katherine. She's not that bad though....</p> <p>Wait, what was I thinking?!?!?! This was Kat! She was annoying. I should hunt. Lack of food was making me think this.</p> <p>Yeah that's it. Lack of food. Lack of blood more like it. Good thing I'm going to feed tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>Ok, so I'm finally gonna find out what a vampire looks like when they're feeding.</p> <p> Why am I interested by this??? Oh right, cuz I'm weird :D</p> <p> Soon Alice and everyone else came home. We played charades until it was night.</p> <p>Emmett, like the big lovable fool he is, pretended to be Avril Lavigne.</p> <p>Only the Lord knows what goes on in the mind of Emmett Cullen. And why he's obsessed with Avril.</p> <p>When it was ten, I went upstairs to my room. I dropped on my bed and lay there in the darkness. I didn't have to sleep yet.</p> <p>I just thought about what was going to happen tomorrow. Was it messy? Was it like in Vampire Diaries?</p> <p>I fell asleep after about two hours with one thing on my mind.</p> <p>What do you wear to watch a vampire hunt???<p><strong>Just pretend that's Kat over there, even though it's Bella. Buuuut if you never saw the movie, you would think it's Nina Dobrev right???? :P</strong></p> <p><strong>___________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I woke up, and remembered something was gonna happen today...something big.</p> <p>Birthday? No, had that already. Emmett falling out a window? No, he never does the same idiotic act twice.</p> <p>Oh right!!! I'm gonna see Edward feed. Cool...</p> <p>I got ready and went downstairs. I had breakfast, and watched TV for the whole day.</p> <p>There was nothing to do and they had some really good movies at their place. I was starting over the entire Harry Potter series again.</p> <p>After about ten, I had some chocolate chip cookies and pulled on a dark pair of jeans, a black shirt and pulled my hair into a ponytail.</p> <p>I put converse on my feet, after throwing out half of the wardrobe to find them, and checked the time.</p> <p>Good,good. Quarter to eleven. I didn't take a jacket. I like to feel cold.</p> <p>I walked to Edward's room and knocked on the door, feeling excited.</p> <p>He opened the door. "You know, most people would be scared to watch a vampire hunt."</p> <p>"Yeeaaaa, but I'm a werewolf," I said grinnig up at him.</p> <p>Edward opened the door a bit more so I could come in. Cool, I never saw his room before.</p> <p>"I like your bedroom. The only thing it's missing is well, a bed," I said, teasingly.</p> <p>"Yeah yeah," he mumbled.</p> <p>"Come on, let's go. Hop on," he said.</p> <p>"I can run ya know," I told him.</p> <p>"We're going really deep into the woods, and well, there are caterpillars there," he said looking at me with a smirk on his face.</p> <p>How did he know I hate caterpillars??? Anyway, I jumped on his back.</p> <p>Edward leapt out the window. Jesus Christ!!!!!! This is amazing!</p> <p>He ran so fast, my hair actually got slack. It was amazing. And it felt so cold.</p> <p>Soon he stopped. I hung on to him.</p> <p>"You know, you could come off," he said.</p> <p>"But what about the caterpillars?" I asked, peering down at the ground.</p> <p>"On the way there are caterpillars, there aren't any here," he said.</p> <p>Well gee, now I felt dumb. I slipped down walking over to a log carefully, looking out for any of those bugs.</p> <p>"Soooo."</p> <p>"If you want, you can climb the tree. You can see better from there," Edward said.</p> <p>"That tree's kinda tall...and straight....and smooth," I pointed out.</p> <p>"Right." He put me on his back again and scaled the tree like a monkey. Edward set me down where I could still see.</p> <p>"So when's it gonna happen?" I asked. </p> <p>"You're rather impatient aren't you?" he asked, smiling at me.</p> <p>"Yeah kinda."</p> <p>"Watch."</p> <p>A deer ran past. Edward crouched down, without falling off the branch and leaped. I watched in awe as he tackled the deer and broke it's leg bones.</p> <p>I jumped down and sat down on the log. Edward looked at me.</p> <p>"You're sure you wanna see this?"</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>"Okay..."</p> <p>He put his mouth to the deer's neck and drained it dry. For some reason it wasn't disgusting though.</p> <p>He didn't let a drop fall. Soon, Edward raised his head to look at me. "Well?"</p> <p>"Well what?" Was I supposed to applaud or something?</p> <p>"You aren't freaked out?" he asked.</p> <p>"No. Surprisingly no," I responded.</p> <p>He caught a few more deer then bent down so I could get on his back.</p> <p>"How about we walk back?" I asked. It had gotten colder and it felt <em>great</em>.</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>We were walking for about two minutes before he asked,"Kat, do you ever miss parents?"</p> <p>I looked up at him. "Like crazy," I said, sighing.</p> <p>We stopped walking and sat down on the forest floor. We told each other what happened to us. Like how he was turned into a vampire.</p> <p>He got up. "We should be heading back though, I forget that you still sleep," Edward said, smiling.</p> <p>I laughed and took the hand he offered me. You know, his eyes were the nicest colour I have ever seen.</p> <p>What I didn't realize was that those eyes were getting closer. Edward's forehead pressed against mine.</p> <p>Why wasn't I pushing him away? He traced one ice cold finger against my cheek.</p> <p>Edward inclined his head towards mine. And he pressed his mouth to my lips.</p> <p>Edward Cullen was kissing me.<em>And I liked it.</em></p> <p>As stupid and as corny as it sounds, there were actually fireworks. I am never making fun of those girls I read in books again.</p> <p>I kissed him back. He put his hands on my hips and pulled me closer. I slipped my hands around his neck.</p> <p>He didn't stop me. Edward put his hands around my waist and kissed me harder.</p> <p>Wait a minute.....HE HAD A GIRLFRIEND!!! I didn't want to at all, but I pulled away.</p> <p>"What is it?" he asked me.</p> <p>"Edward...what about Bella?"</p> <p>He cursed. "Kat, I am so sorry about that," he told me.</p> <p>"Don't be."</p> <p>He looked at me. "Can you do me a favour?"</p> <p>"I won't tell Bella," I told him, before he could ask me.</p> <p>"Thanks," he said looking relieved. Edward put me on his back and ran all the way back to my window.</p> <p>I still couldn't believe it. I kissed Edward. I liked it. This isn't good.</p> <p>He set me down gently inside my room. I expected him to leave but he leaned down and kissed my cheek.</p> <p>And then, in a flash, he was gone.</p> <p>I changed my clothes and put myself in my bed, all in a daze.</p> <p>I didn't like him. I hated him. He was the most annoying person in the world.</p> <p>Right?<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>When I woke up this morning I didn't jump out and run to the bathroom as usual. </p> <p>I lay down, put my hands behind my head and thought. For a long time. About what happened last night. It wasn't a dream, I was sure of that.</p> <p>I got up, did the usual, and went downstairs. Everyone except Carlisle and Esme were there.</p> <p>"Good morning," I said.</p> <p>They all responded.</p> <p>"Sleep well?" Edward asked me.</p> <p>I knew he was worrying if I had any nightmares about what I saw last night with him and the deer. "Perfect."</p> <p>After I pulled put a glass from the cupboard and turned around, everyone's eyes were on me. "What?"</p> <p>"You two, just had a conversation, and there were no insults?" Emmett asked, looking as though he was in shock.</p> <p>Oh right we were suppose to hate each other. I poured out a glass of orange juice.</p> <p>"Yeah well, he's ok, I guess," I told him.</p> <p>No need for Emmett, or anyone else, to know about that. Just then, the doorbell rang and two seconds later it opened.</p> <p>Bella walked in. Ew. I still hate her, but that's not really news. She walked over to Edward and kissed him.</p> <p>Immediately, I wanted to punch her in the face. Not that I don't always want to do that but now I have an actual reason.</p> <p>Why was I so mad? I didn't like Edward. I didn't. I didn't. I think.</p> <p>I turned my back to them. I couldn't see anymore of it.</p> <p>"I'll be up in my room if anyone needs me," I said loudly and set down my glass and went upstairs.</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>The minute Bella walked in, I felt worried. She came over and kissed me.</p> <p>Not as good a kisser as Katherine though. Wait, when did I start comparing Bella to Katherine?</p> <p>I gently pulled pushed her away, just in time to hear Kat say she'll be up in her room. "So Edward, what do you wanna do today?" Bella asked.</p> <p>I looked down at her, trying to think of something to say. You know, I never realized how boring she was.</p> <p>She had the same facial expression no matter what. Geez, look alive. I don't have to, I'm dead. </p> <p>"Uh, I have to hunt, I didn't feed for a long time. Sorry Bella," I told her.</p> <p>"Don't worry Edward. I'm not afraid of you." What does that have to do with anything?</p> <p>"I have to go. Talk to you tomorrow Bella." I turned around and went upstairs, leaving her there.</p> <p>Yeah I felt bad but so what? It's not as if it would show on her face anyway. She always looks the same.</p> <p>I looked for Kat's room and knocked on her door.</p> <p>"Come in, whoever you are," she sighed. I pushed open her door.</p> <p>"Hi," I said. She looked up at me.</p> <p>"Hi." Kat turned away.</p> <p>"I'm sorry Kat," I said. It must have hurt when Bella kissed me.</p> <p>"It's fine, don't worry about it," she said, still not looking at me in the eye.</p> <p>"Kat please look at me."</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Please."</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>I sighed. "What did I do?"</p> <p>"You want to know what you did?!?! You kissed me then you just kiss Bella? What are you Edward a player or something? Why would you kiss me if you were with Bella? Why? And now make me go through this feeling everytime I see you with her? Gosh, now I know why I hat--"</p> <p>I cut her off by pressing my lips against hers. I didn't want to hear her say it. I couldn't.</p> <p>Kat struggled to push me off, but I just wrapped my arms around her waist, pulled her close to me and kissed her deeper.</p> <p>Slowly, she stopped fighting and kissed me back. Kat put her arms around my neck and tangled her other hand in my hair.</p> <p>It felt so good. I pressed one hand against her cheek and kissed her harder. She moaned.</p> <p>After a few minutes, we pulled away. I pressed my forehead against hers. "Forgive me?" I pleaded.</p> <p>"I-I don't know Edward," she sighed, pulling away.</p> <p>"Why?" already missing the feel of her in my arms.</p> <p>"Because I don't want to get that feeling again whenever Bella comes over," she said and walked out.</p> <p>I, like an idiot, just stood there. After ten minutes I went into my own room. Did she really feel that way?</p> <p>Of course she did, Edward, you fool. Where did Katherine go? I had to find her. I needed her.</p> <p>Where did she usually go when she needed to get away? </p> <p>. . .</p> <p>The forest? Oh yeah the forest. I leaped out the window and ran through the trees, desperate to find her.  Because I just realized that what I never thought would happen a few days ago happened.</p> <p>I had developed feelings for Katherine.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I ran into the forest the minute I left my room and went to my secret place. I sat up there and cried.</p> <p>Cried because I didn't know what to do. Cried because I didn't know who Edward would choose. Cried because I just could.</p> <p>I heard a rustling sound. Oh crap. I forgot that they never caught Victoria. Calm down Kat.</p> <p>It might just be a bunny. Yeah... a bunny. Something flashed by.</p> <p>A white bunny.</p> <p>The Thing flashed by again.</p> <p>A white bunny that's bleeding blood. Most animals have red blood.</p> <p>But most animals don't stand on two legs and wear a jacket!!! I opened my mouth to scream.</p> <p>Victoria got in front of me and clamped her hand over my mouth. Oh geez that was so cold. And not the nice Edward-type cold.</p> <p>The cold that said I-Wanna-Kill-You.</p> <p>"What do you want?" I murmed beneath her hand. "To kill me?"</p> <p>Well no duh. But her answer was not what I expected.</p> <p>"Of course not. Death is the easy way out. I'm gonna give you something much more painful," she said, smiling evilly at me.</p> <p>Her stare was so intense I wanted to fall to my knees. But what could be worse than death?</p> <p>No more ice-cream would probably be worse than death. Or if everyone became teachers by some wicked spell Voldemort casted.</p> <p>Then she lowered her head to my neck.</p> <p>Now I know what could be worse than death. Victoria stuck her fangs into me and injected the venom. I screamed like no other.</p> <p>The pain was unbearable. I howled and screamed like a maniac. Victoria dropped me and ran off.</p> <p>Even if I wanted to, I didn't chase after her. And me, taking the easy way out as usual, blacked out.</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>I searched all over for Katherine. I had to find her. To tell her I love her.</p> <p>Suddenly, I heard this scream. And it definitely came from Kat.</p> <p>I raced in the direction. When I saw her, she was on the forest floor, writhing in pain.</p> <p>"Love, what happened?" I cried, holding her face between my palms.</p> <p>She tried to say something, then blacked out. Her neck was bleeding. I managed to control myself.</p> <p>But something looking a like a black drop was on her neck too. Oh no. Victoria bit her. No wonder the love of my life was screaming.</p> <p>Every time she jerked, I felt like stabbing myself. Her pain seemed to affect me as well.</p> <p>It was too late to suck out the venom. If she was jerking around like that and already blacked out, the venom got to her heart.</p> <p>I lifted her ever so gently in my arms, tears spilling down my face and raced her off to Carlisle.</p> <p>I burst through the door. "Carlisle, you have to help her!" I yelled.</p> <p>His face was aghast. "Don't tell me...oh God was she...."</p> <p>"Yes she was and you have to help her right now!!!" I screamed.</p> <p>I couldn't let her die. I wouldn't. Carlisle took her from me and raced upstairs to the medical room with me following him.</p> <p>He hooked her up to some machine. She was breathing normally, but other than that, all signs of life were gone.</p> <p>Carlisle leaned against the wall and stared at her.</p> <p>"WHY AREN'T YOU DOING SOMETHING?!?!" I yelled.</p> <p>"Edward, there's nothing we can do but wait," he replied clamly.</p> <p>I felt sorry for shouting at him but I had to know she was going to be okay.</p> <p>I sat down in a chair and looked at her gorgeous face which was streaked with tear stains. I probably looked the same myself.</p> <p>I love her. More than anything. Since I kissed her, I loved her.</p> <p>Katherine made me feel a way I never did before. Bella sure as hell didn't make me feel that way.</p> <p>Bella made me want to punch a wall sometimes.</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed Kat on her cheek. I didn't care if Carlisle saw me. I pulled away, without looking at him.</p> <p>There was nothing I could do but sit in a chair and wait.</p> <p>And hope she was going to be okay. Hope she was going to be alive.<p><strong>Ok. The pic across there is the colour of Katherine's eyes. But the girl is who I wanted for Kather</strong><strong>ine in the first place, I could just never find a good pic that would fit the original description of </strong><strong>Kat so I went with Nina. So I just thought I'd show it to you :) That's the colour of her eyes though.</strong></p> <p><strong>Kay, explaination done now READ, COMMENT, VOTE AND FAN. :) If you did it already, you're awesome.</strong></p> <p><strong>__________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I remember blacking out. Then waking up what felt like two minutes later and feeling pain shooting through every part of my body.</p> <p>This wasn't supposed to be happening. Yeah, you felt pain but not this much. I asked Jasper about it some time before.</p> <p>I even asked him to make me feel what the pain felt like. And it didn't hurt as much as this.</p> <p>But I couldn't open my eyes. Like you were standing in front of a black curtain, but you couldn't push past.</p> <p>It was dark. Pitch black. And pain everywhere. Suddenly, there was sharp sting in my leg.</p> <p>No, not sharp. Extremely painful that made me want to die rather than live through this. It came again, in my other leg.</p> <p>I felt my body jerking as the pains came. They came faster, peppered all over my two legs. Then it came in my head.</p> <p>I remembered that I could make noise. So I screamed. Louder than a woman giving birth.</p> <p>The pain started to increase. It was in my head, my legs, my arms. Every sting that came, it was like someone tore away a part of me.</p> <p>My body jerked over and over, but I still couldn't open my eyes. It was as though they were too heavy to lift.</p> <p>I let out another scream. And another. Without stopping. Then it came in my heart.</p> <p>As though bullets were going through my heart, all over. I howled, screamed, kicked.</p> <p>Then it stopped. Aaaahhh. That felt good. But no. My body hated me.</p> <p>Instead of the stings only coming in certain parts of my body at a time, all the stings seemed to come together and everywhere, was like someone was pouring hot lava over me.</p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>"Whay is she screaming and jerking like that? That's not supposed to happen!" I yelled.</p> <p>By then everyone was in the medical room.</p> <p>"It's the venom. It's killing out her werewolf genes. She's going to feel a whole lot more pain that the usual pain vampires go through," said Carlisle quietly.</p> <p>There was silence from Katherine all of a sudden. Then screams. Howls. She thrashed around.</p> <p>My heart squeezed. I didn't want to see her in this pain. It was like she was having a bad dream.</p> <p>A nightmare.</p> <p>After the change, Kat would no longer be a werewolf. She would be a vampire.</p> <p>Kathrine would not like that at all. She loved being a wolf. Because she was a different wolf. Jet black wolves were rare, and she loved to be different.</p> <p>I grasped her hand and held it tight. Maybe, just maybe, she might feel it and be comforted.</p> <p>My entire family knew that I loved her. I told them when they came.</p> <p>And they knew I couldn't bear to lose her.</p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>After what felt like years, it stopped. And I still couldn't open my eyes. But it wasn't black anymore.</p> <p>It was sort of blurry and moving all over. It looked greenish and blueish. I wasn't being held down. Just...there.</p> <p>I felt myself being pushed up. Oooohhhh. I was in water. I couldn't touch the bottom.</p> <p>That scared me. For some reason, I didn't have to breathe. I pushed up and up.</p> <p>The surface I could now clearly see. Sunlight shone through. It was an inch away from the top of my head.</p> <p>But I couldn't reach it. I pushed harder and harder. And made it. But there was no need to suck in air.</p> <p>I looked around. Everyone was there. The Cullens, the pack. They were all friends.</p> <p>Emmett and Jacob dunking each other. Leah, Rose and Alice trying to see who could hold their breath the longest. </p> <p>Edward was there too. Talking to Sam. Laughing. I went back under the water again.</p> <p>But somehow, I ended up deep enough not to see the surface anymore. I pushed again and again.</p> <p>Harder. Stronger. Faster. There it was. An inch away from my reach. But no matter how hard I pushed, I couldn't reach it.</p> <p>Like last time. I pushed and pushed, not feeling tired at all. There! I made it. But instead of seeing all my friends again, something else happened.</p> <p>I woke up.</p> <p>I sat up, gasping. My eyes were still closed. Not that I couldn't open them. I could. I just didn't want to. I was scared.</p> <p>There was something soft underneath me. Like a bed. It was a bed. It had the same feel.</p> <p>"Katherine?" I heard a voice ask. It was Edward's.</p> <p>"Love open your eyes. Look at me. At us. Don't be scared." His voice reassured me.</p> <p>So I opened my eyes. My vision wasn't blurry or anything. In fact, everything was clearer than ever.</p> <p>I saw everyone in Carlisle's medical room. Suddenly, someone hugged me.</p> <p>It was Edward. But his arms wasn't cold. Neither was his body. It felt normal. Not warm, not cold. Just normal.</p> <p>He pulled back. I looked at him. He gasped. "What?"</p> <p>"Kat, your eyes," he said. I sat straight up and looked at everyone. More gasps came.</p> <p>"What?" I asked again. I got off the bed and walked over to a small wall mirror. What was the big deal?</p> <p>My eyes were green as normal.They looked a little mixed with blue and black, but mostly green all the same.</p> <p>Then something snapped back into my memory, which was terrible by the way. I turned into a vampire.</p> <p>I was actually a newborn. Newborns have red eyes.</p> <p>I had green eyes.</p> <p>After the change, they should be red.</p> <p>But they were green.</p> <p>Well.</p> <p>That's not supposed to happen.<p><strong>Just pretend it's Katherine in the pic.</strong></p> <p><strong>________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>"So Carlisle, please tell me you can explain," I said nervously. "What happened?"</p> <p>"I don't know," he said. That can't be good. If Carlisle doesn't know, I'm in trouble.</p> <p>"Ok." I managed to hold in my freaking out mood. Everyone hugged me, then left. I really needed those hugs.</p> <p>Only Edward stayed behind. "Edward? What am I?" </p> <p>"You're a vampire Kat. You're...well...you're no longer a werewolf," he said, looking at me.</p> <p>It took a minute of two for that to sink in. When it did, I ran over to him and started crying in his chest.</p> <p>Edward put his arms around me and sat down on the floor, still holding me. He didn't say it was going to be ok or anything like that.</p> <p>He just let me cry. And I was grateful for that. After about half an hour, I looked up at him. "So what now?"</p> <p>"C'mon I'm going to show you how to hunt," he said.</p> <p>"Hunt?" I gulped. "As in, kill animals and drink their blood?" Edward sighed and looked down at me.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>He got up and gave me his hand. I took it and we went into the forest. </p> <p>He showed me how to do it. I tried. I missed. Edward told me to try again.</p> <p>I tried.</p> <p>I missed.</p> <p>"This sucks!!!" I yelled.</p> <p>"Just try again Kat," he said.</p> <p>"No! This is not what I wanted to do! I don't want to drink an animal's blood! I don't want to be a vampire! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!!!!" I screamed at him.</p> <p>"How is this my fault?!?!" he yelled back.</p> <p>"If you had just sucked the venom out of me, this wouldn't have happened!!!" I shouted.</p> <p>"It was already in your system, there was nothing I could do! Don't try to blame this on me! If you hadn't gone into the forest this wouldn't have happened!!!" he screamed with every step moving towards me.</p> <p>I began walking backwards, honestly scared now.</p> <p>"This is YOUR fault Katherine!!! You were the one who made yourself an easy target." I was pressed against a tree now.</p> <p>Edward put his hands on either side of me so I couldn't get away. His eyes had so much anger in them I wanted to cower down.</p> <p>Just when I thought he was going to hit me, he crashed his mouth against mine. I practically melted under his touch.</p> <p>He slammed his body against mine kissed me so passionately my knees would have given out if he wasn't holding me up.</p> <p>Edward put one arm around my waist and the other in my hair. Both my arms were around his neck.</p> <p>He kissed me deeply. Edward pulled away and kissed my neck. I couldn't help myself.</p> <p>I moaned. He sucked on my neck then returned to my lips. His tongue brushed my bottom lip.</p> <p>I opened my mouth and his tongue slid inside, exploring everywhere.</p> <p>After probably fifteen minutes, he pulled away. I leaned my head against the tree, breathing heavily.</p> <p>Edward pulled me off the tree, sat down with his back against the trunk and put me between his legs.</p> <p>My back was against his chest while he played with a loose strand of hair that lay on my arm.</p> <p>"I love you," he whispered in my ear.</p> <p>"I love you too."<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>After we were in the woods, Edward took me to my room. I sat there on my bed.</p> <p>What happened? I loved Edward. I knew that. But now I'm a vampire??? Not a werewolf anymore.</p> <p>I'm gonna miss the pack.....OMG THE PACK!!!! Sam would be furious. Ready-to-kill furious. He hated vampires more than anything.</p> <p>He usually just put up with the Cullens, but I could hear every single thought about them. And it wasn't just the Cullens he didn't like.</p> <p>It was <em>anyone</em> to do with the vampire world. Okay, calm down. I still have two months.</p> <p>I glanced at the calender on my wall. Holy crap. Did time pass that fast?!?!?!</p> <p>The pack was coming back in two days!!! I don't wanna see them. Jake might be okay about the vampire thing. Might.</p> <p>So might Seth. Leah might freak out a little bit, but she might be fine too. Sam would want to fling me out the window.</p> <p>I'm scared. There was a knock on my door. AARRGGGHHHH! Did they came back early??</p> <p>No time to hide. The door was already opening. Oh thank goodness, it was Emmett.</p> <p>"Hey." I tried to sound as calm as possible.</p> <p>And epicly failing.</p> <p>"You ok, Kat?" he asked, looking kind of worried.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>I explained everything to him.</p> <p>"Well, you still have two days. Don't worry about that yet. Besides, you have us," he said smiling at me.</p> <p>Emmett pulled me into a hug. Geez, I love his hugs. He's so big, it's like it's gonna kill you and then it's just relaxing.</p> <p>We talked for a while, then he left. So...what do I do now. I walked over to Alice's room.</p> <p>She opened the door. "I knew you'd be coming," she said, wryly to me.</p> <p>"Shut up."</p> <p>Alice pulled me in. "So what's up?"</p> <p>"Um....what do vampires do...since you can't...ya know...sleep?"</p> <p>She shook her head slowly at me, making me feel like an idiot. Not that I don't always feel like that.</p> <p>"You do what you do in the day. Now go outside, I'm wrapping Christmas presents," she said, shooing me out the door.</p> <p>"Christmas is still a long time away!"</p> <p>"Mhm."</p> <p>Weird girl. I went back in my room and stared into space until morning. When I went downstairs, only Carlisle and Esme were there.</p> <p>Oh no. It looked as though they wanted to have 'The Talk' with me. </p> <p>After ten minutes and thirteen seconds, they were done. It wasn't the talk though. Just basic vampire stuff.</p> <p>Don't close your locker door too hard, stuff like that. They went upstairs after that.</p> <p>I sat on the floor and turned on the TV. Ew. Shake It Up was on. I hated this show. So I watched it.</p> <p>I make fun of them in my mind. The doorbell rang. I took off that horrible show and got up to answer it.</p> <p>Opening the door, Jacob stood there. AAAAAGGGHHHHH. I closed my eyes. I could turn invisible. Hopefully.</p> <p>Well, what better time to find out?</p> <p>"Ha, missed me so much, thought I was a dream. We came back early. Come here!" He hugged me so tight, I wanted to crack.</p> <p>Oh my gosh. Jake was so warm. "Geez Kat, you reek," he said, pulling away and screwing up his nose.</p> <p>"Odd... the smell is coming from you, not off of you," he said.</p> <p>Suddenly, he grabbed my hand. "Kat, why is your hand so cold?" He was on the verge of freaking out.</p> <p>"Yeah well...." I began. I didn't finish.</p> <p>"YOU'RE A VAMPIRE?!?!?!?!"</p> <p>Oh crap, that was loud. I heard footsteps coming down the stairs. "Hi Ka--" Rose didn't finish either.</p> <p>"Woah, Kat what is going on? No, this isn't right. It's some sort of prank right? Kat please tell me you just stuck your hand in the freezer and that's why it's cold." Jake looked like a little boy finding out Santa Claus wasn't real.</p> <p>"God said to tell the truth," I said quietly, peeping up at him.</p> <p>"No, no, NO!!!" Oh no. Jake phased. And ran off. Most likely to the pack's house.</p> <p>Most likely to Sam.</p> <p>Most likely he'll be here standing in front of me in five minutes.</p> <p>"Kat? Are you ok?" Rose asked, putting an arm around my shoulders.</p> <p>"No, I'm not." I began sobbing. I didn't know why. Actually, I did. I was scared. Of losing the pack.</p> <p>Of losing my friends. Of losing the people who were my family since what happened to my parents.</p> <p>I cried into Rose's shoulder. There was a gust of wind. I smelt a horrible wet dog scent.</p> <p>Sam was here.</p> <p>"You're a vampire Katherine!!!!!! What is wrong with you?!?!" he roared.</p> <p>I looked at him. Sam didn't stop. He was really scary when he was mad. He marched up to me as though he was going to punch me.</p> <p>Which he was, since I could see his hand was raised in a fist. </p> <p>"Leave her alone!" Rose stood in front of me.</p> <p>"Oh so this is your new family huh? This is what you replace us with. Leave a werewolf for two months, come back and she's a vampire with a whole new family," he said.</p> <p>"Sam, just give me a chance to tell you what happened," I tried to say.</p> <p>"No Kat. I don't think I want to know. It's a good thing you have the Cullens, or else now, you'd be homeless," he said, venom dripping in his words.</p> <p>"Wh-What?"</p> <p>"You don't belong in this pack anymore. In fact, you were never like us. You were always like <em>them</em>."</p> <p>He phased and ran off. There he went. My family.</p> <p>They were gone. Sure I preferred wolf over vampire. But I liked vampires too.</p> <p>In my mind, I wasn't a monster unless I chose to be.</p> <p>But in the pack's mind, I was. I sat down on the front steps crying.</p> <p>Rose gave me her shoulder, soothing me. It's good to have a shoulder to cry on.</p> <p>I needed it. I sat down on the porch steps, bawling my eyes out into Rosalie's top.</p> <p>Until sunset.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I had my head on Rose's shoulder, still bawling my eyes out, when Edward came walking up to the porch. When he saw me, he flashed over to my side.</p> <p>"Kat, what happened? Why are you crying?"</p> <p>"I'm gonna go now," said Rose, a tiny smile on her face. Edward took her place.</p> <p>I told him everything. About Sam, getting kicked out of the pack. </p> <p>I know I couldn't be in the pack if I was a vampire, but did they have to be so harsh?</p> <p>Make me feel so unwelcomed? As if they hated me from the minute I came?</p> <p>Edward rubbed my back and soothed me. He helped a lot. He took me inside up to my room.</p> <p>"Kat, forget about them. Real family would have accepted you, but said you couldn't be in the pack anymore but you can still live there. Real family wouldn't have done what Sam did."</p> <p>I nodded my head. I honestly didn't want to talk now. Edward talked to me for a little while then left.</p> <p>Outside, there was this flash, thunder came and rain started to pour heavily.</p> <p>Rain.....I love rain. I pulled on a hoodie, took off my slippers and put on a pair of old sneakers.</p> <p>I jumped out the window and began running to my secret place. I climbed to the top of the rock and sat, breathing in the scent of the night.</p> <p>A stick broke behind. OH HELL. I forgot about Victoria. "Remember me?"</p> <p>I stood up and turned around. It was her. "How can I forget you?" I replied.</p> <p>"Hm." In a second, Victoria was up on the rock with me.</p> <p>"Strange, isn't it? Your eyes are still green. That's not normal. Abnormal vampires shouldn't be allowed to live." And with that, she shoved me off the rock.</p> <p>I managed to land on my feet. Victoria jumped down beside me and lunged for me. I dodged, ran behind her and kicked her in the back.</p> <p>She fell, got up, turned around and smirked at me. Then she disappeared. Probably ran into the woods.</p> <p>Something dark passed by. I spun in that direction. Out of the corner of my eyes, I saw the Thing pass by again.</p> <p>I turned in that direction too. Great, now Victoria probably thinks I'm a ceiling fan.</p> <p>Something jumped on my back, knocking me down. I flung it off and ran.</p> <p>Lame, I know, but I was effing scared. To hell with playing hero, I'm running for dear life.</p> <p>I found myself in some meadow. I stopped there. I stood up straight.</p> <p>Three, two, one.</p> <p>I flung myself to the side. Victoria raced pass me. Ha, got that one from Jacob.</p> <p>She turned around and raced for me. I ran again, but there was this huge tree in front of me.</p> <p>And when I say huge, I'm not kidding. You could mistake the thing for a wall. And, like the big idiot I am, instead of turning while I had the chance, ran straight towards it.</p> <p>Victoria was right in front of me now. My back was against the tree. There was nowhere I could go.</p> <p>She raised her hand and went to snap off my head. I shrieked and put my hands in front of my face.</p> <p>Waiting for the impact to come. And waiting. And waiting. Waiting ever so patiently. I peeked through my fingers.</p> <p>There was a massive rock in front of me. That definitely wasn't there before. Victoria was gone. I don't even know if she was alive or dead.</p> <p>I put my hands down slowly. And with it, the rock disappeared. Woah.</p> <p>I put my hands up again. The rock came.</p> <p>Down.</p> <p>Down.</p> <p>Up.</p> <p>Up.</p> <p>Well, I'll just stand here like an idiot and wait for Victoria to come back so I could remind her she has to kill me. I started running back to the house.</p> <p>I leaped through my window, ran downstairs and found Carlisle.</p> <p>Telling him everything that happened, he just sat in a chair.</p> <p>"Well Kat, I think that there just is a possibility that you can control earth."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>He nodded.</p> <p>"Cool!" I exclaimed.</p> <p>"But, that might not be all. To be able to control just one element is very rare. In fact, to even control an element is rare. But I highly doubt it's just earth you can control."</p> <p>"Keep going."</p> <p>"Well, you might be able to control all four elements," he finished.</p> <p>All. Four. Elements.</p> <p>Cool.</p> <p>"But let's test it," he said, getting up. He brought back a glass of water and poured it on the floor.</p> <p>Then he set the glass down next to it. "Get the water to go back in the glass."</p> <p>I knelt down next to it. I put my hand over the puddle of water then carried my hand over to where the glass stood.</p> <p>The water went up in the air in an arc, and went into the glass. Nice. I always wanted to control water.</p> <p>Carlisle lit a candle and put it in the far end of the room. "Out the flame."</p> <p>I lifted my hands, pulled it back, then pushed it with a lot of force. My entire body was tingling, like when I used water and earth.</p> <p>Wind wooshed from where my hands were and went straight to the flame, outing it.</p> <p>Carlisle then lit the candle again, and put a cloth into a metal bowl. "Set the cloth on fire."</p> <p>I stretched my arm out as far as it could go towards the candle and waved it across to the cloth.</p> <p>I honestly didn't know what was the proper way to make the fire, water, earth or air move, I just did what I remember from The Last Airbender.</p> <p>The fire moved in an arc like the water did the cloth started to burn.</p> <p>"Now put out the flames," Carlisle instructed.</p> <p>I pointed my arm to the glass of water on the ground and flicked my wrist, sending water over to the cloth.</p> <p>But not in a thin arc like the others. It was like a wave.</p> <p>Apparently, when I controlled the elements, they became more. Like it wasn't only the amount of water in the glass went to the cloth.</p> <p>Because when I put my arm down, there was still water in the glass. But a whole lot more water than that went to the cloth.</p> <p>"Katherine, you can control the elements! Congrats! A very good and useful ability in the vampire world."</p> <p>I hugged him, then went to my room.</p> <p>I would tell everyone about it in the morning. I picked up the bottle of water from my dresser and emptied it on the floor.</p> <p>Right now, I wanted to play with water.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I was sitting with water in a force field around me when Emmett burst into my room.</p> <p>"Kat, get downstairs quick Carlisle got a letter and is waiting till everyone's there to open it!"</p> <p>He closed my door and raced out, probably to tell the others, without giving the water thing a second glance.</p> <p>Oh well, that's Emmett. I put the water back in the bottle using my amazing super cool ability. :P</p> <p>I got up and went downstairs slowly. Strange, Emmett looked worried instead of excited about the letter.</p> <p>Anxious more like it. I wonder who it was from. By then I was at the base of the stairs.</p> <p>I went into the living room. Alice, Carlisle, Esme and Jasper were there. I sat down next to Alice.</p> <p>Rose and Edward walked in and sat down on the carpet. Then Emmett burst in.</p> <p>"I couldn't find Rosalie and Edwa--" He stopped when he saw them, then sat down and looked at Carlisle.</p> <p>He looked worried. Scared even. So did Esme.</p> <p>"What's going on Carlisle? Who's the letter from?" I asked him.</p> <p>He looked at me staright in the eye. I couldn't help but feel jealous that he had those golden eyes and I still had my stupid green ones.</p> <p>Curse you vampire venom.</p> <p>"It's from the Volturi."</p> <p>There was a noticeable silence in the room. There was before, when we were waiting for Carlisle to answer but now, you could hear a pin drop.</p> <p>And the floor was carpet. That's how quiet it was.</p> <p>We looked around at each other.</p> <p>"Well, we might as well see what they want," Edward stated.</p> <p>Carlisle nodded and opened the letter. He read it, his eyes opened, and then he passed it to me.</p> <p>I was confused why he would pass it to me though. He didn't even let Esme see it.</p> <p>But when I read it I could see why. Alice leaned over my shoulder and read it too.</p> <p><strong>Dear Carlisle,</strong></p> <p>                     <strong>  We have been informed from a certain person from our Coven that there was a new vampire with you. A vampire who was previously a werewolf. And, as the largest Coven of all vampires, we are paying you a visit to see this, abomination. It shall return with us to Italy where it will be tested, then put to immediate death. See you soon,</strong></p> <p><strong>                                                                                                               The Volturi.</strong></p> <p>It. They called me a It. Like I was a potato. But there was more to worry about.</p> <p>"But they can't do that right? Right?" I said, almost hysterically. Alice passed the letter to Edward, who read it out loud.</p> <p>"They can Katherine. They are the largest and most powerful Coven of all vampires."</p> <p>"Well what makes the so powerful huh?? The amount of vampires in their Coven???"I said, this time hysterically.</p> <p>"No, their abilities. Jane especially," Carlisle told me.</p> <p>The door burst open and Bella came running in. Ugh. I hadn't seen her so long I was hoping she died.</p> <p>"Carlisle, I heard the last bits of the letter when I was coming through the door. They're coming to kill me!!!" she shrieked.</p> <p>Bella ran over to where Edward was standing and began to cry loudly (sounding really fake) into his chest.</p> <p>I wanted to rip her off and throw her so deep into the ocean, a new trench would be made.</p> <p>Bella Trench, deepest in the world.</p> <p>Edward's face was hilarious. He looked disgusted and terrified at the same time. He pushed her off.</p> <p>"Bella, I broke up with you. We're done, through. I love someone else now,"he said, looking at me.</p> <p>A small smile came on my face. What I really wanted to do was grin like the Cheshire Cat.</p> <p>She folded her arms and turned away from him.</p> <p>"But Carlisle, what's gonna happen to me? They're going to kill me! I have to be protected!" she said, sound like a....I can't even think of something to call her.</p> <p>"Who's the idiot? Look at it." I grabbed the letter and shoved it in her face.</p> <p>"Exactly, they're gonna hurt me," she sat down and started to crying.</p> <p>"Listen you dingbat, were you ever a werewolf?" I asked her.</p> <p>"No, what are you, stupid?"</p> <p>It took all that I had not to break her neck.</p> <p>"Well, it's not you they want. It's ME. I'm the one who was turned into a vampire, now leave. Your face annoys me," I snapped.</p> <p> She got up and walked out. All of us followed her to the door. We watched as she walked away from the house to her car, but before getting in, she turned around.</p> <p>"Don't worry, the pack will protect me from the Volturi!" she yelled.</p> <p>I took off my shoe and flung it at her. She screamed, even though I aimed for just over her head and wasn't going to hit her, and got in her car and drove off.</p> <p>"What an idiot," Emmett laughed.</p> <p>We went back inside.</p> <p>"Carlisle, the letter didn't say when they were coming," said Alice. I picked it up from the ground and looked at it.</p> <p>"Hey, turn it around," said Jasper. I turned it over. There was something written at the back.</p> <p><strong>                                                28th October, 2012. The forest.<br/></strong>"There's your answer."</p> <p>We talked for a little while longer. Carlisle decided that I wasn't going with them, obviously.</p> <p>And if they refused, we fight,</p> <p>It was risky though, because they were bigger, more experienced, more powerful that we were.</p> <p>I went up to my room when it was over.</p> <p>And sat down and cried. I was scared. Before we had the pack to help us last time we had to fight. My family.</p> <p>Now, there was a small chance we could win, but even if we did win, all of us might not be left to rejoice over the victory.</p> <p>No doubt the person who told them was Victoria. She probably became part of their Coven when Laurent and James got killed.</p> <p>Okay Kat, calm down. We still have two weeks before the 28th.</p> <p>We'll survive this.</p> <p>We will <em>all</em>, survive this.<p><strong>The pic is the necklace Edward gave to Kat.</strong></p> <p><strong>__________________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>I still couldn't believe Bella actually thought it was her we were talking about. And then clings onto me like a liferaft.</p> <p>Talk about desperate. I broke up with her two days ago. I was passing Kat's room when I heard crying.</p> <p>Gently, I knocked on the door. "Come in."</p> <p>I opened the door. She lay on her bed with a book in her hands, and a face that had been crying. But, clearly, she tried to make it look as though she wasn't crying.</p> <p>I walked over and sat down on the bed. "You ok?"</p> <p>"No." Kat sat up and looked at me with those gorgeous green eyes of hers. She looked so sad I would have done anything to make her smile.</p> <p>Even paint my Volvo pink.</p> <p>Katherine looked close to tears again. I wrapped my arms around her and she put her head in my shoulder.</p> <p>And started to cry.</p> <p>"Why am I so different? Why are my eyes green? I wasn't normal as a werewolf now I'm not normal as a vampire either. What am I?!?!"</p> <p>I rubbed her back. "You're you."</p> <p>"So I'm a weirdo."</p> <p>I chuckled. "You're not a weirdo. You're just special. And to be special, you have to be different," I murmered into her hair.</p> <p>She sighed and cried again. I pulled her on my lap.</p> <p>I rubbed her back and whispered soothing things into her ear. After a while, she calmed down.</p> <p>"I wanna take you somewhere," I told her.</p> <p>Carefully, I put her on my back, made sure she was holding on, then leapt out the window.</p> <p>I was taking her to the meadow I found however long ago. The place hadn't changed. I scaled up the tree.</p> <p> I placed her gently on a branch and sat down next to her. </p> <p>From up here in the tree, you could see over the mountains and the ocean past it. It was beautiful.</p> <p>"Woah. This place is amazing. How did you find it?" she asked.</p> <p>"I was just running and I found the meadow. Climbed the tree, and the view was here."</p> <p>She sighed. Not a sad sigh. Not a happy sigh either. A kind of contented sigh.</p> <p>Ok, I had to ask her now. It was the best time.</p> <p>"Katherine? Can I ask you soemthing?"</p> <p>"Sure," she said, looking at me.</p> <p>I took a deep breath. I pulled out a necklace from my pocket, leaned over and put it around her neck.</p> <p>"Will you be my girlfriend?"</p> <p>Kat looked up at me, her eyes shining. "Yes."</p> <p>I smiled. She grinned back at me. Slowly, I leaned over to her. She leaned towards me too.</p> <p>I pressed my lips to hers. She kissed me back. It was amazing. Not like Bella's at all.</p> <p>Whenever me and Bella kissed, it was like getting drenched in a tsunami. But before it didn't seem like that.</p> <p>When I kissed Kat, then I realized how, how ridiculous Bella was. At everything.</p> <p>I moved closer to Kat and put my arms around her waist. She slipped her hands around my neck.</p> <p>Her scent was better than smelling human blood. It drove me crazy. She tangled her fingers into my hair.</p> <p>I kissed her more passionately. Kat moaned and returned it.</p> <p>After a while, we pulled away. I put my arm around her and held her close.</p> <p>Finally, she was mine. We stayed like that until twilight.</p> <p>It might as well been heaven. Getting to hold her close to me for a whole night; better than winning the lottery.</p> <p>But the Volturi was not going to take her away. I wouldn't let them.</p> <p>And if I wouldn't let them take her away, much less would I let them kill her.</p> <p>I put her on my back once more, and ran back to her room. I gently put her down.</p> <p>"Well, I'm going to my room now. You'll probably want to...do what girls do," I said awkwardly.</p> <p>She laughed. I love her laugh. Like tinkling bells.</p> <p>"Bye Edward," she said, shaking her head and trying to hold back a smile.</p> <p>I shook my head back at her smiling slightly and kissed her before leaving.</p> <p>I went back to my room and sat on the couch. Nothing to do but wait until a decent hour to go downstairs.</p> <p>Oh and the necklace, I have the other half. And I will forever.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>After Edward left me in my room, Carlisle came up to talk to me about more stuff he discovered about me.</p> <p>Apparently, I could sleep. I didn't have to, but I could.</p> <p>I was kinda happy about that though because sleep meant dreams and dreams meant....I don't know but I knew I liked dreams.</p> <p>And I had to eat regular food. But not as often as humans.</p> <p>Like...three times a week or so. I could go about three weeks without food. I can't die if I don't eat, but I could get extremely weak.</p> <p>And, unfortunately, I couldn't read minds anymore. And I didn't have a block anymore. Well, that sucked.</p> <p>Don't ask me how he found out all this stuff, but I'm glad he did.</p> <p>And, turns out we have to train. For when the Volturi come. Jasper would teach us.</p> <p>How to fight, fastest and easiest way to kill a vampire, stuff like that. We would need the training though, because it's the Volturi and they're, like, powerful.</p> <p>I checked the time. Ten more minutes. I went downstairs and walked outside into the forest clearing.</p> <p>Emmett, Jasper, Edward and Carlisle made it so we would have place to train.</p> <p>You would think in this huge house they have a workout room.</p> <p>Turns out they didn't.</p> <p>Rose and Alice were already there when I got there.</p> <p>"Hey!" I said.</p> <p>"You seem awfully happy about this," Rose grumbled.</p> <p>"What's up with you?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh she was like that since I came down," said Alice, in her usual cheerful voice.</p> <p>"It's just...I don't know! I just feel like being upset about this training thing ok? I don't like work," she said, flinging her arms into the air.</p> <p>"Who does?"</p> <p>"Emmett."</p> <p>I thought for a while. Actually, Rose was right.</p> <p>"Woah, you're wearing those shoes to train in?!" cried Alice, staring at my Airwalk.</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"No, no, no. You can't."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Because! They don't match what you're wearing!" she pointed out.</p> <p>"Okay. Cool." I never understood Alice. Clothes and shoes and makeup. And hair.</p> <p>She disappeared and reappeared holding a pair of designer sneakers.</p> <p>"Wear that."</p> <p>"You want me to wear designer sneakers to train in?!?!" I screamed. This was ridiculous. But then again, it was Alice.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>I looked at the sneakers, grabbed them and put them on. Who ever said no to Dolce and Gabbana???</p> <p>Just then, Edward, Emmett and Jasper came down.</p> <p>"Everyone ready?" asked Jasper.</p> <p>"Wait, where's Carlisle and Esme?" asked Rose.</p> <p>"They know this stuff already," explained Jasper.</p> <p>"Oooooohh."</p> <p>Jasper began walking further into the clearing with everyone following him.</p> <p>Edward came up and kissed me. "How's everything going? With the vampire stuff I mean?"</p> <p>"It's okay. Turns out I still have some human in me."</p> <p>I told him what Carlisle told me. He nodded. "Good. I'm happy."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Cause I like watching your dreams," he said, smiling sheepishly.</p> <p>I laughed.</p> <p>He kissed me once more, then went over to the boys.</p> <p>Jasper explained what we had to do. He demonstrated using Emmett for a while, but Emmett saw a butterfly and went running off so Jasper used Edward.</p> <p>The stuff was not easy. Jasper made it look like cutting butter. But doing it was like trying to nail jello to a tree.</p> <p>We trained for a pretty long while until we heard someone call out.</p> <p>"Hey."</p> <p>A voice all too familiar.</p> <p>We turned around to find Bella. "What do you want?" Rose asked.</p> <p>"I want to help."</p> <p>I looked around at everyone. Their expressions said, "A human thinks she's gonna be useful. Tell me that when pigs fly."</p> <p>"How could you possibly help us?' I asked.</p> <p>Bella came closer. "Turns out, I do have a mind block. With you being a werewolf Katherine, that was why you could read my mind. If someone were to turn me into a vampire, I could extend that shield."</p> <p>"Who told you this?" Jasper interrupted.</p> <p>"Carlisle."</p> <p>So that was why. Carlisle knew she would be useful. Jane could only make you think you're feeling pain.</p> <p>She can't actually hurt you physically with her ability. And if Bella's mind shield could protect us, it would be an advantage.</p> <p>"Fine," stated Jasper.</p> <p>"Ok."</p> <p>Bella turned around and began walking back inside the house. "Where are you going?" called Jasper.</p> <p>"For Carlisle to turn me into a vampire." she yelled back.</p> <p>After she was gone, we turned around and faced each other. "Bella, huh?" asked Edward, facing Jasper.</p> <p>"She would be extremely useful, Edward."</p> <p>"I suppose," he grumbled, scowling.</p> <p>I smiled a little to myself, and we went back to training until it was night. </p> <p>"Okay, you can go now," said Jasper.</p> <p>"I hate you bro," said Emmett, slapping him on the back.</p> <p>"I hate you too man."</p> <p>We all went back in the house and played cards and Monopoly and Pictionary and basically, whatever we could find.</p> <p>Nobody thought what Bella was doing was noble or anything. Turning herself into a vampire to help us.</p> <p>Because we ALL knew she wanted to become a vampire in the first place. But one thing I was hoping for.</p> <p>That Bella wouldn't have to stay with us when she became a vampire, unless she changed and acted nicer.</p> <p>And even then, I probably wouldn't forgive her.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>Well, Bella's a vampire. Greeeeaaaaaaaat. We all have to take care of her now. Aren't we lucky! (note sarcasm)</p> <p>I walked downstairs and found Emmett on the ground building a house of cards. Hm..he was pretty good. I walked into the kitchen and opened the fridge.</p> <p>You know, I never understood why I even bother to check the fridge.</p> <p>Everything in there you have to cook and that's my worst talent. I poked some stuff around.</p> <p>Okay. Bread. Cheese. I could do that. Not very hard.</p> <p>While I was pulling out the stuff, all the others came downstairs. I greeted them and went back to cutting the cheese, which, for me, required serious concentration.</p> <p>Edward came up and kissed my on the cheek from behind. "Morning, love."</p> <p>"Morning."</p> <p>"You? Making bread and cheese? Out of everything else in the fridge?" he asked.</p> <p>"Shut up, it's the only you don't need a pot for."</p> <p>Edward chuckled and went over to Emmett and watched him build his card house.</p> <p>I started cutting it pretty good though. Until my hand slipped.</p> <p>The knife made a long deep cut on my hand. I grimaced. As soon as I set down the knife, all of the vampires in the room looked at me.</p> <p>Rose and Edward was at my side in an instant. "Kat? Why is there blood on your hand?" he asked, staring nervously down at my palm.</p> <p>"Don't worry, the knife just slipped that's all." Why did he look so... surprised? Not trying to control himself, just surprised.</p> <p>I went to put my hand under the pipe to let the water wash it out when it healed. Oh goodie.</p> <p>That's when I realized what just happened. I spun around, facing everyone, my eyes wide.</p> <p>"Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh. Why do I have blood in me? I'm cold like you guys and pale like you guys and I have blood in me unlike you guys. What's happening? CARLISLE!!!" I yelled.</p> <p>He appeared next to me. "What is it Kat?" he asked, looking worried.</p> <p>"This!" I grabbed the knife and cut myself on the palm.</p> <p>Okay I was being kinda dramatic by showing it to him instead of telling him but hell, I was scared!</p> <p>Carlisle's eyse widened, as he watched a few drops of blood spill, then my cut healed. "Well."</p> <p>"Well...what?"</p> <p>"It seems, that the venom did not completely take over your system," he said.</p> <p>"So I'm part human?" I asked. I hope he says no. I would hate to be a human. They're so normal.</p> <p>"More like part werewolf, since you weren't human before."</p> <p>Yeeeeeessss.</p> <p>"Although, this would make it difficult. You are easier to kill now," Carlisle said, looking worried.</p> <p>"Don't worry about that. You can't smell the blood and I look like a normal vampire. They won't know unless they hurt me and that's definitely not gonna happen," I said reassuringly.</p> <p>He nodded, smiling slightly, then went back upstairs, to put this in his book or whatever he said.</p> <p>"Well, everyone, outside. Time to train," Jasper announced.</p> <p>We all groaned. I ran upstairs, changed my clothes and raced back downstairs, arriving at the same time as Alice, who went to change her clothes too.</p> <p>We didn't even start when Bella came up.</p> <p>"Carlisle sent me. He said I had to train," she said, looking at all of us.</p> <p>"Well, I'll show you. The rest of you, practice what we did last time," said Jasper, walking ahead of Bella to another part of the clearing.</p> <p>Bella smiled at Edward. That's the most emotion I ever saw from her. And I hated it. Edward scowled at her, came over to me, put his arm around my waist and guided me to another part of the clearing.</p> <p>Ha, take that Bella. I heard her 'hmph' and stomp off after Jasper.</p> <p>I snickered under my breath and started to train with Edward. It was completely unfair.</p> <p>He was so fast. Edward was the fastest out of all of us, but who knew he was this fast??? I kicked him and plunked down on the ground.</p> <p>Edward chuckled and sat next to me. "Can't keep up Kat?" he said, smirking at me.</p> <p>I screwed up my face at him. "Damn right I can't Edward. You're too fast."</p> <p>He laughed, then stood up and extended his hand toward me. "Come on. I'll go slower for your sake."</p> <p>I grinned, pulled myself up and we started to fight. And guess what?</p> <p>I beat him!!!! Finally.</p> <p>Yeah right. What really happened was me ending up pressed against a tree and begging for mercy.</p> <p>After a while, it was night. Jasper came back with Bella and said we could leave. We all began walking back to the house.</p> <p>Edward kept his hand around my waist, talking to me until Bella came up next to him.</p> <p>"Hi Edward," she said in an epicly failing sexy voice.</p> <p>"What? Oh--hey." Then he turned back talking to me. She bumped into him. Purposefully.</p> <p>Bella pushed him so hard he actually stumbled against me. When we turned aroud, she was on the ground.</p> <p>Was she retarded of something? "Why are you on the ground?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Edward, you acidentally bumped into me and I fell. It really hurts. Carry a beautiful girl back?" she said, completely ignoring me.</p> <p>It took all that I had not to open a big hole in the ground underneath her.</p> <p>"I didn't bump into you. Come on Kat," he said, picking me up, bridal stayle.</p> <p>"What are you doing Edward?" she asked. You would swear she was blind or something.</p> <p>"What you said," he answered. He took off running with me back to my room.</p> <p>Ooooh. She said carry a beautiful girl back home, meaning her and Edward took me. Haha.</p> <p>I laughed and kissed his cheek. Edward smiled and leaped into my bedroom window.</p> <p>He set me down and kissed me gently. We stayed in room, watching movies without stopping for the rest of the night.</p> <p>Best. Night. Ever.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>Well. This is it. Tomorrow is the day we fight the Volturi. We have to be brave. Strong. Fast.</p> <p>And I'm scared as hell.</p> <p>The two weeks passed by really quickly. We learned a lot from Jasper. Except for Bella.</p> <p>Apparently, vampire venom can cure diseases, but it does nothing for clumsiness. She sucked at everything.</p> <p>So, Jasper made her run. All over the place. At vampire speed. Because, she can't fight so if a vampire tries to hurt her, she runs.</p> <p>Bella had gotten faster. But not as fast as the blasted Edward. The Edward I loved.</p> <p>We spent as much time as we could together. We didn't know if we would be here to enjoy it later.</p> <p>I changed my clothes and went downstairs. The only good thing about all of this, is that I don't have to go to school.</p> <p>For now, anyway. Carlisle said we were going camping or something like that. Thank God we live in the middle of nowhere.</p> <p>Alice was sitting on the couch. I plunked myself next to her. "Hey."</p> <p>She didn't respond. These days, it's been getting really quiet. Like everyone's scared.</p> <p>Which we are, but we didn't try to hide it anymore.</p> <p>"Hi."</p> <p>I sighed. Everything, with everyone, was awkward now. Well, except for me and Edward. But even Emmett didn't say much.</p> <p>And it was <em>Emmett</em>.</p> <p>"What's gonna happen to us?" I wondered, accidentally out loud.</p> <p>Alice stared at me with her eyes wide, as though she saw a ghost or something, but her face was calm.</p> <p>"I don't know Kat. I don't know." I put my head on her shoulder.</p> <p>And started to cry. Alice comforted me silently. Something only Alice can do.</p> <p>This was all because of me. Everyone I loved were risking their lives because of me. Maybe I should just go with the Volturi.</p> <p>How bad could they be? </p> <p>Just then, the door opened and Edward walked in.</p> <p>"Don't even think about it." I managed to smile at him through my tears.</p> <p>He leaned over and kissed my neck then went upstairs. I turned my head back into Alice's shoulder.</p> <p>She twirled my hair between her fingers. Suddenly she stopped. Her entire body stopped moving.</p> <p>I sat up and looked at her. Alice's eyes had a far away look in them. She was seeing something.</p> <p>After, probably half a second, she snapped back. She turned to me with a big smile on her face.</p> <p>What was she grinning about? Did the Volturi magicall die or something? Alice got up and pranced all over the place, exclaiming happily.</p> <p>"Kat! It's gonna be okay! I saw something!! We're gonna liiiiiiive!!!"</p> <p>Then she ran off, probably to tell the others. In a second, the entire living room was filled with the Cullens and Bella.</p> <p>"What happened? What did you see?" asked Edward, cluthing his sister's arm.</p> <p>"I saw us. All of us. At a party. Having fun. There were people talking. Well, us talking. The Volturi died! We won!!" she exclamied, getting excited all over again.</p> <p>Relief washed over everyone's faces. Including mine. "Oh thank goodness!!! You don't know how hard it's been being so depressed and emo all the time, geez!" yelled Emmett.</p> <p>Edward swung me around and kissed me deeply.</p> <p>WE WERE GONNA LIVE!!!!!! WOOHOO! :D</p> <p>And Alice, being Alice, threw a huge party. She invited everyone from school. Even people we didn't know who were there.</p> <p>At the end of the night, the house was a mess. If it wasn't for us being able to move so fast, we would have been exhausted from cleaning.</p> <p>"Well, I'm going to bed. Goodnight everyone!" I called.</p> <p>"You're going to sleep?" asked Rose, an undescribable expression on her face.</p> <p>I laughed. "Yeah, turns out I can sleep." She and the others waved me goodbye.</p> <p>Edward kissed me then I went upstairs to my room. I hadn't slept for a pretty long time.</p> <p>Now I can actually sleep, without worrying about tomorrow. I took a shower, pulled on a huge t-shirt I borrowed from Emmett and crawled in my bed.</p> <p>I grabbed the air condition remote and put it on the lowest temperature. I wanted to freeze tonight.</p> <p>My eyes closed and right before I fell into a deep sleep, my eyes hsot open again.</p> <p>Oh no. I couldn't sleep anymore. Well I could. But I might have nightmares the entire night. I grabbed a book and started to read.</p> <p>Reading calms me down. Soon, I was lost in the world of magic with Septimus Heap.</p> <p>(A/N Septimus Heap is a series. I don't know if you know the books, but I love them so I had to include it :P)</p> <p>I went to sleep, tossing the book on the ground. But I still couldn't get it out of my mind.</p> <p>Didn't Alice say that the future was always changing?</p> <p>That she could only see what might happen?<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>When I woke up, I was not feeling good. I wasn't tired, how could I be?</p> <p>I was terrified. Today was the fight. Ok. Gotta calm my nerves. I'm fine. Perfectly calm.</p> <p>Someone knocked on my door and opened it. I leapt out the window.</p> <p>"Kat? Why did you just jump out the window?" Someone poked their head out my window.</p> <p>Oh. It was just Emmett. I jumped back inside. "I saw a bunny." What? It's Emmett, he believes anything.</p> <p>"Really? Where?!" he cried, looking around excitedly.</p> <p>"It ran away. So what's up?" I asked, trying to change the subject. Or else Emmett might spend the entire fight trying to find it.</p> <p>"Oh, right. Carlisle wants everyone to come downstairs at ten."</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"Well byyyyyyyyye!" He hugged me then went running off. I heard him calling to Rose to help him find a bunny.</p> <p>You would think with Emmett being the biggest he was rough and dangerous but the guy wouldn't hurt a fly.</p> <p>Unless he was trying to catch it. He tried catching a fly once. Ended up somewhere in France because he wanted THAT fly not some other fly.</p> <p>I checked the time. Good, still half an hour before I had to go. I went downstairs in the kitchen.</p> <p>Hopefully Edward was there. Oh yay! He was. "Edwaaaaaaaaaard." I sat on on of the chairs by the counter.</p> <p>"Yes, I'll make eggs and bacon," he interrupted me.</p> <p>"Thanks."</p> <p>Edward smiled, kissed me lovingly, then went to the fridge. Bella walked in.</p> <p>"Oh, hi Edward. Can you make me some eggs and bacon too? I'm starving," she said, batting her eyelashes.</p> <p>Retard. "You're a vampire. How can you be hungry for human food?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Then who's that for?"</p> <p>"Me," I answered.</p> <p>"Why?" she asked, stupidly.</p> <p>"Because I'm hungry," I said slowly. Maybe she was dropped when she was younger. Edward snickered.</p> <p>"But you're a vampire, you don't need human food. What are you, stupid?"</p> <p>I slapped her. I couldn't help it. How can you expect me to live with a thing like that???</p> <p>Bella scoffed and walked away. "And Edward? Don't bother with the egss and bacon, I'm not hungry anymore," she called.</p> <p>"It is humanly impossible for anyone to be so idiotic. But hey, she's a vampire. Guess there's no limit," said Edward, placing the plate in front of me.</p> <p>I cracked up. He laughed with me, while pulling out a bottle of orange juice and pouring it out.</p> <p>"I can't cook. I can pour orange juice into a glass," I said, getting up and taking the glass and orange juice from him.</p> <p>"Yeah, but you might try to boil the juice or something," he said, smirking.</p> <p>I stuck out my tongue at him. Edward grinned back at me.</p> <p>I finished my breakfast and went by the sink and began to wash them. But I got kinda lazy so I just twisted around the water to make it finish faster.</p> <p>"Lazy," Edward said, smiling at me.</p> <p>"I get it from you," I shot back.</p> <p>He smirked, came closer and kissed me.</p> <p>I kissed him back. He wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me closer to him. I slipped my arms around his neck.</p> <p>Edward deepened the kiss. He flicked his tongue across my bottom lip. I kept my mouth closed, just to annoy him.</p> <p>He let out a growl. He put his hands on my waist and lifted me onto the counter, my legs on either side of him.</p> <p>Edward left my lips and began kissing down my neck. He found my soft spot and sucked on it.</p> <p>First gently, then harder. I moaned. He took advantage of that and quickly slipped his tongue inside my mouth.</p> <p>I loved him so much. He explored all over my mouth. The heat between us was nearly unbearable.</p> <p>I moaned into his mouth. He pulled away again and sucked on my neck. I arched my back, begging for more.</p> <p>He sucked harder then returned to my lips. Edward put his hands by the hem of my shirt. I pulled him closer.</p> <p>He kissed me more passionately. He put one of his hands up my shirt. I didn't want to at all, but I pulled away.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" he murmured, moving back to my neck. "Maybe a little too much. We are in a kitchen you know," I said, breathing heavily.</p> <p>"So you're saying if we weren't in a kitchen..." he pulled away from my neck to smirk at me, breathing heavily as well.</p> <p>"I didn't say anything," I said jumping off the counter smiling slightly.</p> <p>I was about to talk in the living room when he took my hand and pulled me back. Edward pulled me against his chest.</p> <p>He pressed his forehead against mine and stared straight into my eyes. "I love you, Katherine," he said sincerely.</p> <p>I smiled. "I love you too," I whispered.</p> <p>Edward tightened his grip around my waist and kissed me. Soft and sweet. He pulled away and stared at me, his eyes full of love.</p> <p>I kissed him back. Just a short kiss. He took my hand and we walked into the living room.</p> <p>We were the first ones there. He sat down on the couch and pulled me on his lap, burying his face in my hair.</p> <p>Soon, everyone was here. Carlisle came in and sat down.</p> <p>"I didn't ask you here to make any big long speech, I just wanted to say that whatever happens, happens. Look out for each other. Protect each other."</p> <p>We nodded. We were all scared. We just refused to let it show.</p> <p>"I'm scared," announced Emmett.</p> <p>All of us but Emmett. Rosalie rubbed his shoulder. We all chatted for a little while longer, then Edward took me up to his room.</p> <p>We put on a movie. Pirates of the Caribbean. Love that show. I relaxed in Edward's arms.</p> <p>He began to massage my shoulders. Geez, he was good. Slowly, the fear I had about the fight dissolved.</p> <p>Edward whispered in my ear throughout the movies. We put on all the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Suddenly, we heard Carlisle calling us. </p> <p>I glanced at the time. Geez, half eleven already? (In the night, btw)</p> <p>I gulped. Edward gave me a reassuring smile. "Don't worry. You're smart. You're fast. You'll be fine."</p> <p>I nodded. He lowered his head and kissed me. Then he took my hand and we walked downstairs. Everyone was there, nervous looks on their faces.</p> <p>(A/N I know I forgot to say what time the fight was, so let's just say midnight in the forest!)</p> <p>Carlisle had been looking out the window. He turned around and looked at all of us.</p> <p>"We leave now."<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>We were running through the forest. Carlisle wasn't sure where it was, but he figured it was the same place Victoria turned me.</p> <p>So I ended up in front. Thankfully I remembered where it was. Even though I had to backtrack a couple of times.</p> <p>Soon, we were there. I had on a brave face but inside, I was freaking out. A wave of calmness washed over me all of a sudden.</p> <p>I smiled at Jasper and thanked him. If it wasn't for him, I'd probably go ballistic. Edward wrapped his arm around my waist.</p> <p>Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Bella give me a nasty look and walk off. </p> <p>He pulled me towards his chest. "How are you feeling?" he asked.</p> <p>"Terrified."</p> <p>He kissed me. "Don't be. We'll win. And we will all survive. Okay?"</p> <p>I nodded. "Okay."</p> <p>Edward kissed my neck. I sighed deeply, trying to calm myself. He looked at me. He took one look at my face and crushed me against his chest.</p> <p>I buried my face in his shirt. I wanted to cry. He pressed his lips on my head. I then realized what scared me the most.</p> <p>I was scared of losing him.</p> <p>Edward pulled away and pressed his forehead against mine. "Don't worry. I'll always be here for you," he whispered.</p> <p>I nodded. He pressed his lips against my mouth, a kiss filled with so much passion. </p> <p>I kissed him back with just as much passion. "They're coming!" cried Rosalie.</p> <p>Edward and I broke away. I took in a deep breath. I could smell them. I didn't know what they smelt like, but the scent in the air changed from leaves and whatever else.</p> <p>Edward gave me one last kiss, before going over to stand at Alice's side.</p> <p>Jasper arranged us in a sort of line. I was Edward and I were at both ends. I blinked.</p> <p>When I opened my eyes, the Volturi stood in front of us. Geez, they got here pretty fast.</p> <p>"So," Caius was the first to speak. "Hand it over, and we will leave peacefully."</p> <p>I AM NOT AN IT!!! </p> <p>"I'm sorry, but we cannot do that, Caius," answered Carlisle, his voice sounding confident.</p> <p>"And I'm guessing you are this...this abomination we have heard about?" asked Aro, gesturing towards me.</p> <p>I nodded. "Well, we shall have to finish you off and take the thing with us then," said Jane smiling sweetly at all of us.</p> <p>A cold smile. Alec stared at me. Red eyes. I knew vampires had them but the still gave me chills.</p> <p>Five more vampires stepped out of the shadows. We were outnumbered by one. But they were old and more experienced.</p> <p>It was like us against a thousand vampires.</p> <p>"Ah, wait Jane. Why don't we let the thing decide whether or not she's coming? Are you?" asked Marcus.</p> <p>"Never," I spat out.</p> <p>Jane smiled even colder. She lifted her head just a fraction. I guess she was doing the hurt thing.</p> <p>Apparently Bella had up the shield. Jane's smile disappeared. Her face became dark. Her eyes flashed.</p> <p>She was probably putting more pain or whatever you call it.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>Oh God. No. My eyes were seeing things. Emmett is gonna walk out of those woods yelling, "Haha! you should've seen your faces!"</p> <p>I turned around and stared at the trees. Nothing but green with chunks of white here and there.</p> <p>Rose raced up to Edward and gently took the shirt from him. She began to shake uncontrollably.</p> <p>Edward slipped his arm around her shoulders. I went up to them and rubbed Rose's back.</p> <p>I won't cry. Not yet. Rosalie didn't need to see a bunch of crying faces. She needed to see people who would be strong for her.</p> <p>Jasper sniffed the air. "I can't smell anything," he said, sadly.</p> <p>We could tell Alice was trying to see if anything was happening but nothing was since she didn't say anything.</p> <p>I felt my eyes beginning to water. I sucked them back in. Something nudged my hand.</p> <p>I glanced down and saw Jacob. I smiled, a tiny little smile, barely noticeable. Jake looked at me with sad eyes.</p> <p>He once told me Emmett was his favourite one out of all of them. He didn't know why, he just liked him.</p> <p>I patted his head. Kneeling down, I buried my face into his fur. Sure, it smelled like wet dog. But right now, it was somehow comforting.</p> <p>Jacob pulled away from me and he, Seth, Leah and Quil went to Rosalie. She knelt down next to them.</p> <p>Seth rubbed his nose against her arm. Rosalie's eyes began to fill once more, before she hid her face in his fur, sobbing.</p> <p>Jake and the others crowded around her. I guess she needed warmth. Warmth and comfort. Something my brothers and sister would always have.</p> <p>Even though the rest of my family wasn't here.</p> <p>Suddenly, something cracked. Like a stick or something. Leah pulled away and stood in front of Rose, shielding her from anything that might come her way.</p> <p>Absentmindedly, all of us came closer together, until we were all standing in one little huddled group.</p> <p>Something white flashed by. No, that wasn't possible. We pulled apart all of them. Right?</p> <p>A vampire stood in front of us, his clothes ripped where we pulled off his limbs. Wait a second...</p> <p>That was the vampire I saved Bella from. "Guess you didn't do a very good job, did you?" he laughed.</p> <p>Before we could leap at him, he raced around, picking up various chunks of white. Not all though, just some.</p> <p>Alice leaped forward and grabbed about two white pieces when he wasn't looking. She tossed it down to Quil and Seth, who covered it.</p> <p>Edward made a dash for him, but he was already gone. He was pretty fast. Raced into the forest, so fast I didn't even see which direction he went in.</p> <p>(A/N I couldn't resist...direction.....ONE DIRECTION!!!! &lt;3 :D)</p> <p>I turned on Bella. "Bella, did you throw the pieces of him into random parts of the forest, or the same place?" I asked slowly.</p> <p>"The same place. Why? Didn't make a difference," she said carelessly, shrugging her shoulders. I felt rage grow inside me.</p> <p>I felt a wave of sudden calm come over me. I thanked Jasper with my eyes.</p> <p>If it weren't for him, I might end up drenching Bella, making a big hole underneath her feet, make wind blow on he so hard she shook with coldness, then setting the retard on fire.<p><strong>Okay everyone.

This story will be finished! I just don't know when.</strong></p> <p><strong>Bye :(</strong><p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>*Two weeks later*</p> <p>A lot of  time has passed, since the Battle of the Clearing (Emmett named it).</p> <p>Edward and I are still going strong, and no sign of Bella.</p> <p>For a day or two, I was kinda worried, but then I gave up on her, I still didn't like her.</p> <p>The pack and I are ok now. Well, Sam and I are okay. The rest of the pack is awesome. I missed them so badly.</p> <p>Jake started talking to me again. I asked them how they found out about the fight, and apparently, Seth smelled vampires around, which weren't us, and they came to look around.</p> <p>I sat down on the island in the kitchen, literally on, I got tired of using the chairs, and was eating scrambled eggs Esme made.</p> <p>Since I became a vampire, I could eat whatever I want whenever I wanted. I didn't get fat, it didn't harm my body in anyway.</p> <p>Nearly everyday was fast food. And ice-cream. Life was good.</p> <p>I shoveled another forkful of eggs into my mouth and looked around at the kitchen, marvelling how clean everywhere was.</p> <p>The kitchen at the pack's house always smelt of burnt toast. Jacob and Seth weren't the best cooks when Emily wasn't there.</p> <p>Just then, Edward walked in. He raised an eyebrow at me sitting on the island, but grinned after and kissed me.</p> <p>"Good morning."</p> <p>"Morning," I replied.</p> <p>"How did you sleep?" he asked innocently.</p> <p>"As if you didn't know," I said, smirking.</p> <p>Since I became a vampire, and probably before that, he came in every night to look at my dreams.</p> <p>He ducked his head, grinning shepishly. I finished off my eggs and went to wash the plate.</p> <p>Edward grabbed the plate. "Go on in the forest, I'll wash it."</p> <p>"How did you know I was going in the-- nevermind," when I saw him smirking.</p> <p>Sometimes I wish he couldn't read minds. It got annoying with him predicting everything, like Alice.</p> <p>"But you love it," he said grinning.</p> <p>I glared at him playfully then went outside. I liked to go for runs sometimes. Stretch my legs, visit Thunder.</p> <p>Thank God Carlisle thought of getting someone to take care of my horse, else it probably would be dead by now.</p> <p>I loved animals, but wasn't that responsible. I had a hard enough time trying to remember if I had homework.</p> <p>I waved to Joey, the horse guy, and went in to visit Thunder. </p> <p>Joey was nice, but I learned not to get to close to him. He knew we were vampires, and was scared of us, although we never did anything to him.</p> <p>Superstitions, I guess.</p> <p>I stroked his sleek black mane, and fed him an apple from the fruit bin outside. Thunder reared his head and looked at me accusingly.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I didn't come to visit you that often. There was a lot to do," I apologized.</p> <p>He looked at me sternly. "Fiiiiiiine," I groaned.</p> <p>I got out a saddle and saddled him. Even though I could run faster than my horse, riding him still felt amazing.</p> <p>He walked out of the stable on his own, he knew the way well enough.</p> <p>For a while, Thunder and I rode as fast as we could, then he broke into a slow trot, going back to the stable.</p> <p>I made sure he was, you know, clean-looking; and gave him three more apples.</p> <p>Then, I walked deeper in the forest. I loved this place more than anything.</p> <p>And the best part is that I haven't even been everywhere in it, so there was still more to explore.</p> <p>I walked until I didn't recognize anything. Suddenly, I got the feeling I was being watched.</p> <p>I'd been getting it for a while but I didn't take any notice of it.</p> <p>Something dark flashed by from the corner of my eye.</p> <p>That had been happening a lot too. Except it used to move slower. Now it was fast.</p> <p>As fast as a vampire. I sniffed the air warily. No new scent, just the forest. </p> <p>I began feeling uncomfortable. I sped off, as fast as I can, until I found a few familiar trees, and followed them until I came to the house.</p> <p>I pushed open the door and was about to walk in when I saw that dark thing flash by again.</p> <p>Strange, I always saw it deep in the forest, never around the house.</p> <p>In fact, I saw it in places I didn't recognize. Whatever it was, it was getting stronger.</p> <p>And faster.</p> <p>And braver.</p> <p>And more daring to come this close to the house.</p> <p>Or maybe I was just imagining things as always.</p> <p>Still, I went inside where it felt safe.</p> <p>I had a grilled cheese sandwich, I got Emmett to make it, he makes the best grilled cheese sandwiches EVER, then went up to my room.</p> <p>I stuck in my headphones and played Taylor Swift- Long Live.</p> <p>I loved that song. It reminded me of Harry Potter and Narnia.</p> <p>Walking over to my window, I dragged a chair over and plunked myself in it, staring at the forest.</p> <p>There it was! The dark thing again. But this time it went fast, then paused for the smallest while, then disappeared again. </p> <p>Almost as though it was taking a lood at me.</p> <p>I slammed the window down, pulled the curtains over it and flung myself down on the bed.</p> <p>I went to sleep. It was the middle of the afternoon, but I didn't care.</p> <p>Sleep was one of the few places where I felt safe.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I awoke on my bed in the middle of the night. Edward sat on a chair close to me.</p> <p>"Do you always go to sleep in the afternoon?" he asked, an amused look in his eyes.</p> <p>I made a face at him.  He smiled and pulled me off the bed onto his lap.</p> <p>Edward kissed me softly. As I kissed back, the kiss turned more passionate until I suddenly stopped.</p> <p>"What wrong?" he asked, with a concerned expression on his face.</p> <p>I remembered why I went to sleep so early somewhere in the middle of the kiss.</p> <p>"Nothing," I mumbled.</p> <p>He frowned at me. "Sweetheart, what's wrong?"</p> <p>"It's just..." I sighed. "Ever been out hunting and got the feeling you were being watched?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Actually I have. And something dark flashing by?"</p> <p>"Yes! You've seen it too?" I asked.</p> <p>"I have. Everyone has, as a matter of fact, we just didn't say anything," he replied.</p> <p>"I- I just had to let it out."</p> <p>"Of course you did Kat! I wasn't blaming you or anything. Has it ever done anything to you?" he asked, suddenly looking worried.</p> <p>"No, no. It's just that it's getting faster. And stronger," I said.</p> <p>"Yes, I've noticed that too. But I wouldn't worry about it."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"I don't know. Probably because I don't feel like any drama right now," he said.</p> <p>I know the feeling.</p> <p>"Love, are you alright? You look a little pale," Edward asked me.</p> <p>"I always look pale," I muttered.</p> <p>He laughed. "No, I mean, when last did you go hunting?"</p> <p>I didn't reply.</p> <p>"Kat," he said, looking at me sternly.</p> <p>"I'm sorry okay? I just...forgot."</p> <p>He chuckled. "You forgot to eat. Ha."</p> <p>He lifted me up and put me on his back. "We're going to get you something to eat. Now."</p> <p>"Don't you mean something to drink?" I asked cheekily.</p> <p>He smiled, leapt out the window and sped off toward the forest. I felt a bit nervous, but Edward was here and he'll protect me.</p> <p>Edward scaled a tree and set me down on a branch. He crouched down and became immobile, watching.</p> <p>I faced the opposite direction and did the same.</p> <p>About two minutes later he had a mountain goat and I caught a deer. We drank our fill and caught a few more before deciding to go home.</p> <p>The dark thing flashed again, just I was throwing the deer's body in the bushes. I crouched down and stayed still.</p> <p>Edward must have sensed it as well, because he was doing the same.</p> <p>Suddenly, he leapt forward and disappeared. I remained in my position. Soon he came back.</p> <p>He pushed down the Dark Thing. Which was Bella.</p> <p>A Bella with two arms. Hey, she found it.</p> <p>"What were you doing creeping around like that?" I yelled at her.</p> <p>She didn't answer.</p> <p>"Well?" asked Edward, waiting expectantly.</p> <p>"I was hungry and I don't know how to hunt so I drank what little all of you left behind in the bodies," she said, staring up at Edward.</p> <p>Of course. She answers him but doesn't answer me.</p> <p>"Why did you come so close to the house?" I demanded.</p> <p>"No reason," she muttered. I wasn't entirely convinced.</p> <p>"Just go away and leave us alone. If you want to eat our scraps do it where we can't see you," Edward snapped, looking at her with disgust.</p> <p>"Okay Eddie!" She disappeared.</p> <p>Geez, if Edward told her to kill herself she would.</p> <p>He cursed her under his breath then picked me up and took us back home.</p> <p>Edward dropped me off in my room. I wanted to change and get rid of my blood smelling clothes.</p> <p>Hell, he probably read my mind and that was the only reason he left me in my room.</p> <p>I stripped off my clothes and put myself in the shower. It was cold outside, and a hot shower felt good.</p> <p>But I couldn't help but wonder, why did Bella pause at my window? Why didn't she keep running?</p> <p>And why did she keep going after Edward? I mean, I knew she liked him and all, but he was treating her badly just so she would stop and leave us alone.</p> <p>Edward would never treat any girl like that, I knew. Unless he was doing it on purpose, like with Bella.</p> <p>It didn't seem to be working.</p> <p>I sighed and stood in the shower for a long time, thinking things over in my head, before coming out and putting on some clothes.</p> <p>Well, Bella could be a vagrant in the forest, I didn't care. Harsh, but after all the things she did to me, it's kinda hard to forgive her.</p> <p>I'm not her, not my problem.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I woke up feeling like crap. And I didn't know why.</p> <p>Climbing out of my bed, I looked at myself in the mirror. Ah, now I know.</p> <p>It was probably because I didn't turn on the air condition in my room before going to sleep.</p> <p>I gave myself a cold shower, which felt pretty good. Going downstairs, I heard a rattling noise.</p> <p>Walking into the kitchen, Emmett stood there, a knife in his hand. When I saw what he was doing, my eyes nearly popped.</p> <p>"Emmett!!!! Why?--"</p> <p>"You looked hungry in your sleep, so I made you this," he said, a big grin lighting up his face.</p> <p>On the counter, there was a huge plate filled with probably a dozen grilled cheese sandwiches.</p> <p>I smiled, shaking my head at him. "Thanks Emmett."</p> <p>"But why did you have the knife?" I was confused. All the sandwiches were on the plate.</p> <p>I peeped around him. He was cutting up one of the sandwiches.</p> <p>Into <em>tiny bite-size pieces.</em></p> <p>"You really have nothing productive to do with your life, do you?"</p> <p>"I got bored, and you were taking long to get up," he said defensively.</p> <p>I grinned, and started on the sandwiches, which, by some miracle, were still hot and they tasted amazing.</p> <p>After I ate, I washed the plate and sat down on the couch, bored out of my mind.</p> <p>What to do? I watched all the movies, read all the books. I'll just go for a run. See if Bella was still there.</p> <p>I was thinking I might be nice to her today, and teach her how to hunt.</p> <p>Might as well forgive her, and I couldn't let her die. Well, I could, but I wasn't that mean.</p> <p>I dashed outside and ran straight in the forest, dodging trees and other obstacles. </p> <p>Stopping at a gigantic tree, I turned to see how far I was. I didn't recognize anything, so I had to be pretty far.</p> <p>Something dark flashed by. Okay, guess Bella was here. But then another dark thing flashed by. And another.</p> <p>The Things seemed to be walking in a circle, surrounding me.</p> <p>Oh dear.</p> <p>Well, no use staying here. I was about to start running through a break in the circle, when the Things stepped out.</p> <p>The Volturi.</p> <p>What colour I had left in my cheeks drained away. My eyes widened.</p> <p>How could the Volturi be here? How--</p> <p>Then I saw one of the five vampires. The one who survived and took the pieces with him.</p> <p>There wasn't any Jane, but there was one of the five, Aro and Marcus.</p> <p>"Well, well, well. Look what we have here," said Marcus, smiling coldly.</p> <p>"The Abomination," replied Aro.</p> <p>No duh, Sherlock. And I am not an abomination!</p> <p>"Where's Jane, hmm? Oh wait don't tell me. She probably just lost her head when you got defeated," I said smiling sweetly at them.</p> <p>Marcus growled at me, sending me a death glare at the same time.</p> <p>Well, best to find out at least some information should I die here.</p> <p>"How did you know I was here?" I demanded. I would've caught their scent while I was running or something, if they were following me.</p> <p>"You're in no position to ask questions, but nevertheless, I shall answer," said Marcus.</p> <p>"A little birdie told us where you were," said Aro.</p> <p>"Who?" Who could've told them?</p> <p>"Well let's see," said Aro, turning around and lifting a hand out toward the trees. "Come now, don't be shy."</p> <p>Out of the shadows, one person stepped out.</p> <p>A person with two arms. Not one.</p> <p>With brown hair, and the most boring face ever.</p> <p><em>Bella.</em><p><strong>Here's a pic of Katherine, in case you forget how pretty she is!!! :)</strong></p> <p><strong>________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>Okay, seriously? Bella? That...that....that MUDBLOOD!</p> <p>I couldn't think of anything else, forgive me. </p> <p>Why would she tell them? Did she really hate me that much? She was standing right in front of me, so time to get some answers.</p> <p>"You? Why would you tell them? Why do you hate me so much?" I wanted to scream, but the words came out softly.</p> <p>"You took Edward away from me, Katherine. He loved me. He still does," she replied, her voice cold.</p> <p>"No he doesn't! He left you! How many times does he have to say it before it can get through your thick skull?!" I screamed.</p> <p>"I want him, Kat. One way or the other he will be with me."</p> <p>"Oh really? And how do you intend to do that?" I asked, a smirk coming on my face.</p> <p>"Simple."</p> <p>She came closer to me and before I could stop her, Bella pulled a single strand of hair from my head.</p> <p>Bella took the strand and put it in her mouth. </p> <p>Under normal circumstances, I would have been like, "Eeew," but this wasn't normal, and I wanted to see what she was doing.</p> <p>Her  face began to look odd. She turned her head in a slow circle. Her hair got a little darker, like mine.</p> <p>Her skin became paler, and her body got taller. Bella's hips got smaller. She kept her head to the ground.</p> <p>But when she looked up, it was like staring into a mirror. Her eyes were green. Like mine.</p> <p>Her hair was brown, like mine</p> <p>She, in fact, was me.</p> <p>I whimpered. "How? How did you--" I couldn't finish.</p> <p>"Ever wondered what my ability was, Kat? No, you never did. Well, you found out," she said, with a sweet smile on her face. She even sounded like me.</p> <p>Calmly, she put her hand inside her mouth and drew out the strand, dropping it on the ground.</p> <p>I was expecting her to turn back to normal, but she didn't.</p> <p>Bella must have noticed my confusion, and horror at the same time. "All I needed was your DNA. Now that I have it, I will stay like this for exactly forty-eight hours," she explained.</p> <p>She came closer and ripped out seven more strands. "I'll be back for more," she said, smiling pleasantly, but cold.</p> <p>Suddenly, I was thinking. What the hell was I doing? One flick of my wrist and I could kill all of them.</p> <p>Concentrating, I imagined a big gaping hole in the earth. Nothing happened. I closed my eyes. Still, nothing happened. What the hell?</p> <p>Felix was the only one who could contain your abilities, and he was dead. Then I noticed Bella.</p> <p>"No, that's impossible," I said out loud.</p> <p>"Of course it is Katherine. Stupid girl," said Aro. I'd almost forgotten he was there.</p> <p>And, one last Dark Thing stepped out from the forest.</p> <p>I gasped. It was Felix. No wait, he looked different. He spoke, "So you are the Abomination my brother has spoke of."</p> <p>"Brother?" </p> <p>"Please, you cannot possibly think all vampires have no siblings. I am Harold, his brother who has the same ability as he does. I cannot do anything else, but that," he said, a dark look crossing his face.</p> <p>I got the feeling he was jealous of his brother, being the ruler and all that, while he was just that, his brother.</p> <p>I sighed. Apparently, I wasn't going to be able to do anything for a while.</p> <p>"What are you going to do with me?" I asked fearfully. Forget playing Wonder Woman, I was scared.</p> <p>"Well, you Katherine, will come with us to Italy where we will analyze you, make sure you can't make any others like you, and then put you to death," said Harold calmly.</p> <p>"Please, the Cullens will come looking for me faster than you can even blink," I snapped.</p> <p>"And that, is where I come in!" said Bella, dancing in happiness. "I told you I'd get him," she said smugly.</p> <p>Of course. They would take me, do whatever, kill me, and all that time, Edward would be with someone else.</p> <p>Someone who looked like me. But she still wasn't me. They really thought this through.</p> <p>He would be with the same faker he was with a few months ago. My eyes watered. I had to get free of these people.</p> <p>"Unfortunately, we cannot take you just yet. We will have to stay for about three days, to make sure everything goes smoothly," said Marcus.</p> <p>"Go now," he said to Bella.</p> <p>She gave me a cold smile, then ran deeper into the forest. I could see her go steady for a millisecond, before she smacked into a tree.</p> <p>I snickered, then turned away.</p> <p>Marcus stared at me, hatred in his eyes. </p> <p>Trust me old man, the feeling's mutual.</p> <p>Aro returned with a coil of rope, which he began to tie me up with. Well that's stupid. I'm a vampire, it's like telling someone to stay in a room and not locking the door.</p> <p>But the rope smelled odd. After a deep smell, I realized they soaked the rope in gas. Aro tied a huge knot for my hands, but left a long piece trailing after. He did the same to my feet.</p> <p>That was actually smart. All they had to do was light the end of the rope on fire, and watch it speed toward me if I started to act up.</p> <p>Aro grinned devilishly at me. I glared at him.</p> <p>Aro and Marucs left, saying something about needing to feed. They left Harold guarding me.</p> <p>There were two boxes of matches next to the log he was sitting on.</p> <p>"And now we wait," he said, idly striking a match, letting it burn down before putting it out and dropping it on the ground.</p> <p>What to do, what to do? If only Edward was reading my mind right now, but a likely chance he wasn't he knew I hated it when he did that.</p> <p>Well I liked it in a weird way, but not all the time, it would be like an invasion of privacy.</p> <p>The pack! Oh no, I wasn't a werewolf anymore. I wouldn't have a connection with them anymore. Or would I?</p> <p>Carlisle did say I had some werewolf in me, my eyes didn't turn gold, to my disappointment, and I still had blood in my veins.</p> <p>It was an extremely long shot, but it was better that nothing.</p> <p>Edward was not going to be with that imposter.</p> <p>She could look like me, sound like me, wear my clothes and act like me, but no one could <em>ever,</em> be me.<p><strong>Dear ZoEy16,</strong></p> <p><strong>Remember how you said I should make a super long chapter just for you and I said I might? Well here you go, thank you so much for commenting on nearly every chapter I wrote, it's helped a lot. Now go read my story!!! :D</strong></p> <p><strong>______________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Edward's POV</strong></p> <p>I sat on the couch, waiting for Kat to get back. She went in the forest, I knew that for sure.</p> <p>So adventurous, I loved it. I loved her as well.</p> <p>And that's why I was going to ask her to marry me. Soon, I'm not sure when, but I will.</p> <p>I was about to pick up the remote and turn on the TV when Katherine burst in through the door. I smiled.</p> <p>"Kat, love, this is the longest you've spent in the forest," I said, kissing her sweetly on the lips.</p> <p>"There was a lot to see," she said, smiling back at me.</p> <p>I took her hand and led her to the kitchen. It was already night, and even though she might not be hungry, I still wanted her to eat something.</p> <p>I just made a simple sandwich for her, even though she knew how to do that without burning down the house.</p> <p>Kat took the plate and ate slowly, staring off into space. "What's wrong?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Nothing, why?"</p> <p>"I don't know, you're just not acting like yourself. More quiet than usual," I said, grinning at her.</p> <p>"Yeah, just you know...thinking," she said, giving me a small smile.</p> <p>"What about?" I asked her curiously, while washing her plate.</p> <p>"Us."</p> <p>"Well, what about us?" I asked, putting away the plate and coming up behind her, wrapping my arms around her waist.</p> <p>"Just, replaying our past. You know, like how you always used to stare at me in cla-- I mean, how we hated each other and look at us now." She laughed nervously.</p> <p>"That's the funny thing about love, sweetheart." I pecked her cheek. Katherine leaned her head back into my shoulder.</p> <p>I spun her around and kissed her. She smiled, then pulled my head closer. Odd though. Her kiss didn't feel like it used to be.</p> <p>Felt more, sloppy. Did something happen to her in the forest? Something she's not telling me? She was kissing like...like Bella.</p> <p>I drew away. "What's wrong?" she asked.</p> <p>I stared in her eyes. I could've sworn I saw something red flash in them. "Nothing Kat, I just...feel really tired. I'm just gonna go up to my room."</p> <p>"Okay..." she looked at me uncertainly before leaving the kitchen. I pressed my hands against the counter.</p> <p>Something wasn't right.</p> <p>Glancing out the kitchen, I saw her sitting on the couch laughing at something on the TV. It was Shake It Up.</p> <p>She was laughing at something on Shake It Up. Katherine hated that show more than anything. Why was she laughing at it? Their jokes were terrible.</p> <p>I saw her change the channel. Ok, maybe she was just flipping through and that joke was rarely funny. </p> <p>She probably wasn't watching it at all. The other channel was showing Harry Potter, the third one, I think.</p> <p>And then I saw something that Katherine Dobrev would NEVER do.<p><strong>Hi everyone, do me a favour and check out this book, "The Immortal Hunter". If you like Twilight, you should like this book. Do it for my friend, thank you!</strong></p> <p><strong>_________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I was getting tired. Not as in weary, but tired of getting lost. Did I really go that far in the forest?</p> <p>Stopping, I turned around. Hey, I remember that tree. It's the one Jacob had put me in and refused to take me down.</p> <p>Well, let's go that way.</p> <p>I started running,but something stopped me in my path.</p> <p>Shoot. I forgot about him. It was one of the five vampires. I'm gonna nickname him Ooftv. Get it?</p> <p>(Abbreviation without the full stops for 'one of the five')</p> <p>"Please, just leave me alone. Please." I really wasn't in the mood to fight anyone right now. I didn't even want to fight Bella. Wasn't that proof enough?</p> <p>"Why? Think of how Aro and Marcus will repay me for bringing them what they seek," Ootfv said, staring off into space.</p> <p>I smirked. "Bad news Ooftv, they're dead. So please, go away."</p> <p>"What did you call me?"</p> <p>"Nothing, so bye!" I turned to run but he caught me by the wrist.</p> <p>"Not so fast," he said.</p> <p>"What could you possibly want with me now?" I demanded.</p> <p>"Well, you've caused an awful lot of trouble for me, haven't you?" he asked, glaring at me.</p> <p>Probably did, just don't know what I did. "What did I do?"</p> <p>Ooftv's face darkened. "You and your silly friends killed all of my friends! And you will not get away with it!"</p> <p>"Okay, seriously dude? Revenge? What happened to karma?" I asked.</p> <p>He reached his hand toward my neck. I yanked myself from his wrist and ducked before he could catch me.</p> <p>Darting behind him, with a quick move, I popped his head straight off his shoulders.</p> <p>Dodging his flailing arms, I dismembered him, then realized I didn't have anything to start a fire with.</p> <p>The fire we used to burn the last of the Volturi had already gone out. I could see his fingers twitching around.</p> <p>Oh dear.</p> <p>Suddenly, Leah appeared next to me, matches in her hand. "Go, and good luck Kat," she said, smiling.</p> <p>"Thank you," I whispered before rushing off. The Cullens' house came into view after retracing my steps a few times.</p> <p>I ran up to the door at human speed and took a deep breath. I was afraid of what I would see. </p> <p>Edward and Bella? What if Edward didn't believe me? What if Bella convinced him that she's the real Kat?</p> <p>And worst of all, what if Edward believes her?</p> <p>Well, I'll never know unless I open the door. I turned the knob and pushed it slowly. No one.</p> <p>Good or bad?</p> <p>I didn't want to call out, for no reason in particular. Walking into the kitchen, I saw chunks of white all over.</p> <p>Sucking in a breath, I realized it was me. Well Bella, but in my form. So they found out...</p> <p>I kicked the head until it rolled over. Hm, Bella was changing back. Her eyes were wide open, but they were red, instead of my colour, green.<p><strong>Okay, I'm only putting up a pic of her hair because, it's kinda the only thing that matters. You have a description of the outfit and nails. I can't find a pic of the makeup so, use your imagination people!</strong></p> <p><strong>Btw, HAPPY MCR DAY!!!</strong></p> <p><strong>_____________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>Rolling over in my bed, I looked up at the ceiling and sighed. It felt good knowing nothing would trouble me today.</p> <p>Or should trouble me.</p> <p>I got up, and took a long shower before going downstairs. There was a slight breeze beside me and there Edward stood.</p> <p>"Good morning sweetheart," he said, wrapping an arm around my waist and kissing me.</p> <p>I kissed him back before replying. "Hungry?" he asked. </p> <p>"Not really, no" I responded.</p> <p>"Okay, go get ready."</p> <p>"For what?" I asked, confused. Were we going somewhere? Where? Why doesn't anyone tell me these things?!</p> <p>"It's a surprise," he said mysteriously. "Wear something casual and meet me in my room whenever you're ready."</p> <p>He gave me a slight push before disappearing. Still confused I walked upstairs, going to Alice's room to see if she knew anything about this.</p> <p>She had the door open before I could knock. "Alice--"</p> <p>She cut me off. "I knew you'd be coming! Okay, stay here I'll be back in a minute, just have to get some stuff for you..."</p> <p>I looked around as Alice flashed around her room, gathering things in her hands. She stopped in front of me and pushed me down in a chair.</p> <p>Alice pushed the chair over to her huge mirror and swung me around so the back of the chair was facing the mirror.</p> <p>She had a tube of lipstick in one hand and eyeliner in the other. </p> <p>"Hold up," I said, raising a hand before she could apply it to my face.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"What's going on?"</p> <p>"I'm gonna get you ready! Edward said I could but not to go overboard, sadly" she answered, perky as ever.</p> <p>"Get ready for what???" I asked. Like I said, no one ever tells me these things.</p> <p>"For your date tonight!" she exclaimed.</p> <p>"He told me to get ready just five minutes ago and to meet him in his room when I was done. I don't think he expected me to take the whole day!"</p> <p>"Trust me sweetie, Edward knows what he's doing. He told me to make sure you were ready by eight tonight."</p> <p>"But--" I started but she cut me off.</p> <p>"Okay! Stop talking. He knew I would take really long to do this that's why he gave us whole day. Even with two people!"</p> <p>"Two people?" I felt like a serious idiot having to question everything.</p> <p>"Yep, Rose is out getting your clothes and I'm here doing your makeup. I like to do that first."</p> <p>I opened my mouth to speak again but she waved her hand, shutting me up.</p> <p>Fun fact, Alice takes extremely long to do makeup, which is ridiculous. When I asked her why so long during the short break she gave me to get some water, she said she has to do it <em>perfectly.</em><p><strong>That's the ring over there, hope you like it!</strong></p> <p><strong>__________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>The wind rushed through my hair as Edward ran through the forest. It was a cold night, I loved it.</p> <p>Trying to figure out where he was taking me, I glanced around, looking for something familiar. All I saw was a tree I had climbed hiding from a caterpillar on one of my runs.</p> <p>I gave up and buried my face in his shirt, closing my eyes until I heard him say,"We're here."</p> <p>I opened my eyes and found myself in the field he once found. I looked around.</p> <p>Right there, in the middle was a table with a red tablecloth covering the surface, a bottle in the middle and glasses.</p> <p>Dinner, for two vampires, in the middle of a field. Interesting.</p> <p>Edward took in my confused expression with a chuckle. "You'll understand when we get to it," he whispered in my ear.</p> <p>He held out his hand to me. I smiled and took it, and we walked slowly in a comfortable silence.</p> <p>When we got there, I gasped. On the plates were slices of raw deer with pools of blood at the bottom. There was a small bowl of caviar next to each plate, and a bottle of wine in the middle.</p> <p>Next to the plates were empty wine glasses.</p> <p>Sounded disgusting? That's a vampires heaven.</p> <p>A huge grin came across my face, and I suddenly wanted to eat <em>now.</em> Edward gave a pained groan.</p> <p>"You have no idea how hard it was setting this up and not being able to take any," he said.</p> <p>I giggled. He smiled at me and pulled out a chair. I took my seat and after Edward sat, we attacked the meat ravenously.</p> <p>Edward gave me the good idea of putting a little blood on the caviar before eating it. It tasted amazing!</p> <p>After we finished eating, Edward picked up the bottle of wine. I tried to see what kind it was but there were no labels on it at all.</p> <p>"Emmett's specialty," he responded to my curious face.</p> <p>"Emmett makes wine?" I asked, bewildered.</p> <p>"Actually, I have no idea. While he, Jasper and I were setting it up he just plunked the bottle in the middle and said "You guys would love it"," Edward replied, pouring it in the glasses.</p> <p>I'll admit, I was a little cautious about tasting it, considering Emmett recommended it.</p> <p> After a tiny sip, I realized it was human blood. But it tasted a little different, as though he mixed something with it.</p> <p>I made a mental note to ask Emmett what was in it, and if he could make it again.</p> <p>"You know, it doesn't taste bad," commented Edward, looking at the red liquid in his glass.</p> <p>"Surprisingly, it doesn't taste bad," I added, grinning.</p> <p>He grinned at me and we finished off the wine like the greedy beasts we were.</p> <p>Edward stood up and gave me his hand. "What now," I asked.</p> <p>"Now we run."</p> <p>"To where, exactly?"</p> <p>"You know that cliff, overlooking the sea?"</p> <p>"I thought I was the only one who knew about that place!" I exclaimed.<p><strong>ATTENTION TO ALL READERS. I would like to thank holliemurray for the amazing cover she made, and give her all credit. Well, you know, except for the font colour :P Thanks Hollie! :)</strong></p> <p><strong>___________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I woke up to find myself on top of Edward, his fingers stroking my hair. "Good morning, love," he whispered, smiling down at me.</p> <p>I smiled back and went back to sleep, I was still drowsy. Hm, I dreamed something strange last night.</p> <p>I dreamed that Edward proposed to me. And Emmett made this strange mixture using blood and chocolate.</p> <p>Of course, I wish it wasn't a dream. Thank God in Dreamland I said yes when he proposed. Strange, I could even remember the ring in detail.</p> <p>I heard Edward give a small laugh. Taking no notice of it, I reached up my hand to brush away a strand of hair that was tickling me.</p> <p>Something hard and cold touched my face. I glanced down at me hand, to see a ring.</p> <p>A ring on the fourth finger of my left hand. Wait a second...</p> <p>I sat up. Edward let out another laugh. "No sweetheart, it wasn't a dream." He pushed the hair that had fallen in my face behind my ear.</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>Edward just gave me an amused smile. I felt like an idiot. What girl forgets she's engaged?</p> <p>"You do, and you're still perfect," murmured Edward, leaning down and kissing me gently.</p> <p>I kissed him back, giving a small moan as he sucked on my lower lip.</p> <p>Tangling my fingers in his bronze hair, I sunk myself into the kiss, thinking of nothing but him. His fingers raced up and down my back, making my skin feel tingly through the thin nightgown I wore. Edward's hands went to my neck, tracing up and down, then running it across my jawline.</p> <p>But then I remembered I had something to do. Something important. Reluctantly, I pulled away.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" he whispered, kissing my jaw.</p> <p>Sadly, I pulled away farther from him. "I have to tell the pack," I whispered.</p> <p>"Don't worry, they'll be fine with it," he told me, holding my cheek. "I know Seth will."</p> <p>Of course Seth would be okay with it. He particularly liked the Cullens because Alice gave him a ton of shorts.</p> <p>And because of Esme's, Edward's and sometimes Emmett's cooking.</p> <p>"It's not Seth I'm worried about. It's the other 's' in the pack."</p> <p>Edward's face hardened the slightest bit. "Sam would come around with time."</p> <p>"Time," I mumbled.</p> <p>"Hey, we're both vampires, we have all the time we need to wait for him," said Edward, cracking the smallest smile. "And didn't he accept you?"</p> <p>"He did, it's just that it was hard enough for him to take in the fact I'm a vampire, can you imagine him finding out I'm engaged to one and going to living with them?" I asked, nibbling my lip.</p> <p>"Well, you've practically been living with us so that's one thing to scratch off your list."</p> <p>I gave him a wry face. "I'm going to go get ready now, and as soon as I eat, I'll go see them."</p> <p>Edward gave a pained groan. "Calm yourself, because I won't be back until tomorrow." I told him.</p> <p>He sat straight up. "What?!"</p> <p>I began shifting through my clothes. "I imagine Emily and Leah would want to hear the entire story, like the other girls did, and they will insist, considering I won't be with them for some time. So I would spend the night there."</p> <p>He groaned again. "Relax Mr. Cullen, you've been alive for years, you should have nothing but patience."</p> <p>Edward suddenly appeared in front of me. "As a matter of fact, I have a lot of patience. I put up with you, didn't I, Mrs. Cullen?" </p> <p>He smirked then was suddenly out of the room, managing to lock the door as he went. Grinning, I shook my head and went into the shower.</p> <p>Mrs. Cullen. It made me sound so old, and I was so young! I wondered what Jessica would say...</p> <p>Jessica...school... OH NO! Carlisle, being Carlisle, managed to get the principal to allow me to be away from school that long.</p> <p>And here I was, thinking it was still holidays. I would have to go back to school, although there wasn't much to do. Well, there wouldn't a lot of learning. Only revising, and endless study halls.</p> <p>Our final exams would be coming up. I stuck my head out of the shower and glanced at the calender that hung on the wall.</p> <p>Final exams were next week. Today was Thursday. There was no way I could cover all that work.</p> <p>I sighed. Maybe Carlisle could work his magic. I stepped out, put on some clothes and went downstairs to ask him about it.</p> <p>"Carlisle, about school--" I started, but he cut me off.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it Kat. We could teach you everything you need to know. Just ask. And, according to your principal and everyone else at your school, the Cullens pulled you out to be homeschooled."</p> <p>"But what about the new things they taught this term? I wasn't there at all!"</p> <p>"They wouldn't have taught anythign new, only revision on the other things they did in the past." he replied calmy.</p> <p>"How do you know all of this?" I asked, cocking my head to the side.</p> <p>"I have childeren who went to different high schools all the time for the past seventy-five years, and the same thing was done at each. How I not know?"</p> <p>I gave a sigh of relief. "Thanks Carlisle. How do you do these things so easily? And where are you when I'm in detention and want to leave early?"</p> <p>He chuckled, and handed me a plate of scrambled eggs and bacon. Dang, that smelled good.</p> <p>I ate quickly, then grabbed my bag of toiletries, told Esme the plan and went up to see Edward before I left.</p> <p>He kissed me goodbye as quick as he could, because I knew I wanted to be off soon.</p> <p>The Alice, Jasper and Rosalie were out hunting and Emmett was... Well I don't know where Emmett is. But I didn't worry too much.</p> <p>I slung my bag over my shoulder and ran outside, but Emmett dashed out and stopped me.</p> <p>"Kat, do me a favour and give this to Seth."</p> <p>He shoved a piece of paper in my hand. Oh, so there he is.</p> <p>"What is it?" I asked.</p> <p>"Top secret stuff. DO NOT READ IT. Promise me you won't?" He stuck out a pinky.</p> <p>I groaned and promised. Emmett grinned, knowing that I won't read it because I swore.</p> <p>Pushing it in my pocket, I ran in the forest, taking a shortcut to the pack's house. I slowed down after a while, it seemed like a waste just rushing past all the scenery like this.</p> <p>I heard footsteps behind me. "Hello Katherine."</p> <p>I spun around. I got a little scared all of a sudden. But I wasn't going to let her get to me. Well, I wasn't going to let her <em>see</em> that she got to me. I made my voice neutral.</p> <p>"Bella."<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I was scrunching up my toes in my sneakers. Oh boy. Why did I have to stop?</p> <p>Most people, when they hear footsteps behind them, run even faster, but no, I had to be an idiot and look to see who it was.</p> <p>"Katherine."</p> <p>Her voice was cold, dead. Bella stared at me, her eyes glowing red. Guess she wasn't sticking to animal blood.</p> <p>"What do you want?" I asked, annoyed when I heard my voice shaking. Ok, yes, I was scared. Bella might not know how to fight, but she was stronger than me, considering she took human blood.</p> <p>Her eyes seemed to dim when she heard my voice, as though she was sad I was afraid of her. Gee, most people would be happy.</p> <p>"I- I just wanted to thank you." She held up the note I had written. </p> <p>I calmed down a little. "What?"</p> <p>"I guess I've been pretty stupid in the past months. Thank you, for letting me live. And, I'm sorry for causing you and Edward all that trouble."</p> <p>She sounded really sincere, and her eyes actually held some emotion. But I could hear the regret in Bella's voice.</p> <p>I didn't blame her. It must be hard, losing someone you love. "Yeah well, it's okay. And... you're welcome."</p> <p>"Well, I'll let you go then." She bowed her head, staring at the ground.</p> <p>I turned to go, might as well escape in case she suddenly turns bipolar. </p> <p>"Oh and," I turned back to her, to see what she had to say," Congratulations," Bella said, nodding to the ring.</p> <p>I nodded. "Thanks." But I didn't go right then. "Bella, I know this might be sort of difficult for you, but, do you want to come? To the wedding?"</p> <p>She looked at me. "Really? You trust me?"</p> <p>"Well, not totally but, yeah, I guess so."</p> <p>Bella nodded slowly. "Yes, I would like that."</p> <p>I nodded my head at her. "Okay--good. Guess I'll see you around then." I took off, not waiting for her answer.</p> <p>I made sure to run through a lot of bushes and vines, trying to get the forest smell to rub off on me.</p> <p>The pack's house soon came into view. I stopped halfway there, and walked the rest of the way.</p> <p>I walked up the stairs and onto the porch. I didn't know if to knock or just walk right in, but while I stood there debating, the door opened.</p> <p>"KAT! You're here!" Leah screamed, and hugged me.</p> <p>"How did you know I was outside?" I asked, my face smushed into her shoulder.</p> <p>"I could smell you from my room."</p> <p>I cringed. Leah's room was all the way upstairs. "And man, you reek. Anyway, don't bother about that, soon you'll be smelling like us again!"</p> <p>She smelled pretty bad too. How did the Cullens go through all of this? Leah dragged me inside the house, which hadn't changed at all.</p> <p>The whole pack suddenly appeared in the livng room, each of them hugging me and telling me how much they missed me, stuff like that.</p> <p>"Katherine Dobrev, you have been keeping something from us. What is that on your finger, my dear?" asked Emily, with a knowing smile on her face.</p> <p>Everyone stared at me. They knew what was coming, they just needed to hear me say it.</p> <p>I looked around, purposely keeping my eyes away from Sam. "Well... Edward and I... are... engaged!" I exclaimed.</p> <p>Even though they might think it was a bad thing, or might not approve of it, I still couldn't control my excitement of that fact.</p> <p>Leah and Emily screamed and grabbed me, in a group hug. A group hug between the three of us. I pulled away and looked around at the others.</p> <p>"Well, Kat, that's awesome, congratulations! Food all the time!" yelled Seth, hugging me.</p> <p>Jake came spun me around, and so did Quil and Embry and the others. That just left one person.</p> <p>"Well Kat, you know I don't like him at all, but if you're happy, that's something I won't interfere with. Congratulations," he said, a small smile on his face.</p> <p>I nodded. "Thanks Sam. It really means a lot." </p> <p>"So, you're spending the night, right?" asked Leah.</p> <p>Grinning, I held up my bag. "Yay!" She clapped her hands. "Wait, a girls' night with only three girls?"</p> <p>"Two, actually. Sam is taking me out." spoke up Emily. "I'm sorry dear, but congrats and I have to go get ready now."</p> <p>Emily left. "Two girls?! That's pathetic." said Leah, pouting.</p> <p>"Well, I do know some other girls..." I said.</p> <p>Leah's head snapped up to meet my eyes. "No, absolutely not."</p> <p>"Come on! Alice loves stuff like this. And Rose is an expert at nail art," I begged.</p> <p>Leah might be a tomboy, but she loved nail polish. Weird fact for a tomboy, but she wasn't ashamed of it.</p> <p>She glanced down at her chipping black nail polish and then sighed. "Fiiiine," she groaned out.</p> <p>"Yay!" I asked Leah to call them, which she did grudgingly, then I went off to find Seth.</p> <p>"Hey Seth, Emmett said to give this to you. Said it was top secret and very important," I called, holding out the note.</p> <p>Seth grabbed it, opened it, then let out a load shout of joy. "Well, what is it?" I asked curiously.</p> <p>"The recipe for his grilled cheese sandwiches!" Seth went running off to the kitchen, probably to try it out.</p> <p>I was confused. Bread, cheese, bread, grilled. Was it that hard? But then again, Emmett probably adds some special ingredient that makes it taste so good.</p> <p>I left it, and went back to Leah, who said they'll be here soon.</p> <p>Two hours later, we were all in the kitchen sampling Seth's sandwiches. They tasted pretty good, a lot like Emmett's.</p> <p>But I guess only Emmett could make it like Emmett. Alice and Rosalie still weren't here. What was taking them so long? They were vampires for crying out loud!</p> <p>Suddenly, I could smell them. I put down my sandwich and walked outside, taking Leah with me.</p> <p>"What took you so long?!" I asked, but I could kind of see why.</p> <p>"Well, Alice here couldn't decide whether to bring her entire room or her entire closet!" said Rose, glaring at Alice.</p> <p>"Please, it's not that much. Just enough to dress us all up!" said Alice, waving her off as she set down a massive suitcase while Rose had a simple bag that looked as though it was bulging with nail polish bottles.</p> <p>"Oh, hi! Leah right?" asked Alice, extending her hand. Leah nodded and shook it. Rosalie did the same.</p> <p>Let's say Leah looked a little more at home with them as she and Rosalie talked on and on about the best way to get bubbles out of nail polish while we went upstairs.</p> <p>We decided to take the guest bedroom, as it was the largest, and got to work.</p> <p>Turns out Alice can fit a lot more clothes into a place that can only hold a certain amount. And the suitcase was huge already, so you can imagine that there was enough to clothe the whole of Russia.</p> <p>Rosalie went to get a glass of water, apparently it helps with the nail polish, and Alice went to get some CD's from downstairs.</p> <p>I turned to Leah. "So?"</p> <p>She sighed, but smiled. "Yes, okay. I like them."</p> <p><p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I woke up on top of nail polish bottles. Let me tell you, it did not feel comfortable.</p> <p>I glanced around, confused about two things. Where I was and how did I ever fall asleep on those bottles. If I wasn't a vampire, I would had a lot of bruises.  Leah was now waking up, and Alice was doing Rosalie's nails.</p> <p>Guess Leah and I fell asleep and Rose and Alice had nothing better to do.</p> <p>"Have you guys been up all night? Or did you just wake up early?" Leah asked them, rubbing her eyes.</p> <p>"Up all night! Vampires don't sleep silly," said Alice, without breaking concentration on Rosalie's nails.</p> <p>Leah gave me a confused look. "I'm not all vampire. Part werewolf, actually," I told her.</p> <p>"Really? What differences?"</p> <p>"Have blood, can sleep, gotta eat and the eyes." Had I never told her this before?</p> <p>Leah nodded thoughtfully. "Well, you girls go get ready, and we'll go downstairs together," said Rose, blowing on one hand.</p> <p>I hid a smile, knowing it was because she didn't exactly feel comfortable going downstairs with a bunch of wolves there.</p> <p>Leah and I showered and dressed quickly. When we got downstairs, apparently Seth made Emmett's sandwiches again, because the scent was everywhere.</p> <p>"Hey girls! Come eat, Seth made way too much for us!" called Embry.</p> <p>My eyes widened. They were werewolves, and Jake ate a lot. How much did Seth make?</p> <p>Leah and I grabbed a plate and stacked sandwiches on them, while Alice and Rose only took one each, eating only to be polite.</p> <p>"Hey, these taste really good! A lot like Emmett's, don't you think Rose?" commented Alice. Rosalie nodded her answer.</p> <p>Seth beamed with pride.</p> <p>After we ate, Alice, Rose and I decided to go back home. We waved to the pack and ran off through the forest.</p> <p>"I like them," said Alice, dragging her suitcase over a bush.</p> <p>"Yeah, they don't seem so bad," Rose admitted.</p> <p>"I told you," I sang.</p> <p>"Anyway, we have a full day today," Alice said.</p> <p>"How come?"</p> <p>"We have to go buy your wedding dress!" she exclaimed happily.</p> <p>I almost tripped. "What?! I didn't even set the date for the wedding yet!"</p> <p>"Okay, when do you want it?" she asked, in all seriousness.</p> <p>"Ummm... I don't know, how about October 31st?"</p> <p>Rosalie raised an eyebrow at me. "Halloween?"</p> <p>"Yeah, it'll be cool to get married on Halloween. Like when all the supposedly fictional creatures come to life. I'll have to ask Edward about it though," I said, wondering if he'll agree.</p> <p>Alice was silent for a moment or two. By now, we slowed down to a leisurely walk through the forest.</p> <p>"If not, it could be on whatever day he chooses," I said.</p> <p>"Oh well, you ask him today, and we'll go looking for a dress, well, today!" exclaimed Rosalie.</p> <p>"You guys are really excited about this, aren't you?" I asked, an amused smile on my face.</p> <p>"Well, duh! It's your wedding Kat! You must be excited too!"</p> <p>"Yeah, I am," I admitted, a smile coming on my face as I day-dreamed about the wedding.</p> <p>Getting married to Edward! After everything we've been through, it was finally happening. I imagined him standing there, looking gorgeous in his white suit.</p> <p>The house came into view soon. I left my bag in my room and walked over to Edward's door. I knocked and he opened it a second later.</p> <p>"I knew you were back! I smelled you the minute you were outside my door!" he exclaimed, pulling me into a hug.</p> <p>I smiled into his shoulder and relaxed into his arms. Edward pulled away and pressed a gentle kiss on my lips. "Missed me?" I asked.</p> <p>"You have no idea how much," he replied, a caring smile coming on his face as he stroked my cheek.</p> <p>Edward took my hand and pulled me in his room, closing the door. I sat myself on the couch and watched him go back to what he was doing before I knocked. "Edward, what day?"</p> <p>"Hmm?" he asked, trying to sort a number of CD's without any names.</p> <p>"What do you think the wedding should be?"</p> <p>He gave me a knowing a smile. "Alice got to you too, huh?"</p> <p>I grinned and nodded. He put down the CD and put his hands against the table. "Any day you want really. Though, knowing you, you'll probably want it to be on Halloween," he said, grinning knowingly at me.</p> <p>A happy look came into my eyes. "Yes! Are you okay with that, though?"</p> <p>He walked over to me. "Of course I am, Katherine. I rather like that day as well." Edward sat on the couch and held my cheek, his gold eyes shining.</p> <p>I leaned forward and kissed him, which he returned. Edward gently slid his hands behind my knees and lifted on his lap in a swift movement.</p> <p>Tangling my hands in his hair, I kissed him harder, which he returned. </p> <p>Edward played with the hem of my shirt, before sliding his fingers in to caress my skin. It sent tingles through my body, wherever his hand went.</p> <p>He kissed me passionately, sucking on my lip and gaining entrance. His hand went further up my shirt, stopping at my bra.</p> <p>We were interruppted by a knocking on the door. Edward pulled away and took his hand out from under my shirt.</p> <p>My breathing was a little heavy, and I tried to calm it while smoothing my hair. Edward re-arranged me on his lap before calling,"Come in!"</p> <p>Alice walked in. "So?"</p> <p>"Halloween," said Edward. She shook her head smiling at us. </p> <p>"Everyone at the wedding will know who chose the date when they get the invitation."</p> <p>I grinned. "Well Kat, it's the last day in September, and Rose is feeling a bit lazy now so we'll go buy the dress tomorrow, kay? We could plan the guest list tonight."</p> <p>Edward and I nodded. "Alice, come on! You and Jasper promised you would help me find my Superman cape!" yelled Emmett from downstairs.</p> <p>She sighed. "Well, I'm off."</p> <p>"Good luck looking for that cape," said Edward. </p> <p>"Thanks, it's needed," she replied, closing the door behind her. I could hear her shout down to Emmett,"Well what do you want that cape for anyway? Last I saw a dog was running away with it."</p> <p>Edward chuckled. "Kat, look what I found while I was at the DVD store," he said, holding up a case.</p> <p>I took it and flipped it over to show the cover. It was a Spongebob Squarepants DVD with Season 3, 4 and 5. I squealed happily. Even Edward liked Spongebob. Who ever said no to the sponge? "Put it on, put it on!"</p> <p>He grinned and took the case from me. "I knew you'd like it." Edward took out the disc and put it in the DVD player. Yes, he has a TV and a DVD player in his room. Can you say lucky?</p> <p>He walked back to the couch and pulled me on his lap once more. </p> <p>Smiling, I pressed my cheek against his chest. I had the best boyfr- fiance ever.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>"Okay so the pack, definitely," said Alice, scribbling on a sheet of paper.</p> <p>"And what about your school friends? Jessica? And the other boy, Mike?" volunteered Carlisle.</p> <p>I nodded. "What if we invite some of the other covens? Tanya, and the others?" asked Edward.</p> <p>A smile came on my face. "Yes! It would be cool to meet them."</p> <p>"Of course, you have to meet them. You'll be the newest Cullen," said Edward, smiling at me.</p> <p>I grinned. Katherine Cullen. Yup, that sounded about right.</p> <p>"Oh and by the way Ed, I kind of, invited... Bella," I said nervously.</p> <p>"What?!"</p> <p>"She changed! And she was all alone in the forest. She even congratulated us on the engagement Edward! Why not? I felt sorry for her," I said, twisting my fingers.</p> <p>Edward gave a long sigh. "Well, since she mainly affected you and you forgave her, I believe she changed from what you told me."</p> <p>I gave him a small smile. "Thanks."</p> <p>He returned it, then went back to choosing other people. Jasper picked up the list and read it out. "Okay, so we have about... a lot of people, because I am way too lazy to count it."</p> <p>"So, did you choose a place yet?" asked Emmett.</p> <p>"The forest," said Edward. I smiled. We chose it earlier that day. Getting married in a church would be weird, considering vampires were supposed to be cursed creatures.</p> <p>"Well, Kat, why don't you come with me and help me put together a menu. I'm not quite sure what the pack would like," said Esme, standing up from her seat on the floor.</p> <p>"Sure," I replied. I felt completely energised, and I wasn't sure why.</p> <p>Esme and I decided anything with meat. They were wolves after all. But I wasn't too sure about what they would want. Maybe Emily could help. And a chocolate wedding cake. Black and white.</p> <p>Alice walked into the kitchen, looking excited. "Kat, Rosalie's feeling better now, so do you want to go buy the dress tonight?"</p> <p>"Tonight! Alice, look at the time! Nowhere will be open this late," I said, wondering if she was mad.</p> <p>"Of course places will be open! You just have to know where to look," she said, winking mischievously at me and sidling out.</p> <p>Esme laughed. "Oh, that girl."</p> <p>"You're coming, right? Please come Esme!" I begged.</p> <p>"Of course I'm coming Kat! It's not everyday you get married," she said, smiling at me.</p> <p>I giggled, and we walked outside into the living room.</p> <p>"Okay Alice, I guess we're going. You do know where to look, right?" I asked. You had to be careful with Alice.</p> <p>"Yes Kat, don't worry. If there's not open, Rosalie knows where to go. And Leah and Emily is coming too. I just called them, they'll be here in half an hour."</p> <p>"Cool." I nodded. So exciting! Buying my own wedding dress!</p> <p>"Emmett! Get your legs off the table! Do you want them to think we live in a pig sty?! Come on Edward, help clean up," said Rosalie, bustling about.</p> <p>I chuckled and went to throw away the crumpled balls of paper that lay all over. Note to self: Never ask Alice to write down anything without a bin nearby.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>For the past three hours I have been trying on gowns, getting opinions, then trying on another one.</p> <p>Turns out the store is a lot more bigger than I thought. And there wasn't anything that I liked.</p> <p>Everything was too puffy, too princess-like. I wanted something simple, but beautiful. Alice read my mind.</p> <p>"Not really your style, huh?"</p> <p>I shook my head ruefully. "That's okay, we can go at Rosalie's choice now. And it's getting pretty late. If anything, we can come back tomorrow," she told me, putting a dress back on the rack.</p> <p>Rose roused Leah, who fell asleep on her lap. Emily was still awake, but she looked tired as well. Rosalie looked at them.</p> <p>"How about we drop you two off at a hotel and let you rest? We can still go looking, but you guys need some sleep," she suggested.</p> <p>They nodded gratefully. We got into a cab and went to the nearest, on Alice's insistence, five-star hotel. Leah and Emily tried to decline, but Rose and Alice were having none of that.</p> <p>Rosalie reserved two suites, one for them and one for us when we got back. We decided to spend the night in New York.</p> <p>"Okay, so there's this store that my friend owns, a bridal store, and I'm pretty sure you'll find what you want there. Most of the dresses she designed herself. The place isn't far from here," Rosalie said, after we got into a cab.</p> <p>Alice grumbled under her breath, but Rosalie took no notice.</p> <p>"Is your friend a vampire?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Yup, she is."</p> <p>"Here we are!" she sang out. We came out and entered the building. Rosalie went up to a salesgirl and asked for someone named 'Jessie'.</p> <p>The girl probably declined because Rose began arguing with her until the salesgirl threw up her hands and walked through a door.</p> <p>A beautiful, tall redhead walked out of the door, followed by the salesgirl. "Carly, I don't see why you didn't tell this customer I was not availa- Rosalie!" </p> <p>The two of them hugged. "Hi Jessie! It's been a while, hasn't it? Look, my friend here is getting married, and she needs a dress, got any suggestions?"</p> <p>"Ooo a marriage, how exciting! Come dear, let me look at you."</p> <p>Shyly, I walked over. "Oh, what beautiful eyes! Okay, well you have a slim figure, so let's see what I can do."</p> <p>She took us into another room, where there weren't any customers. "White, I presume?" Jessie asked, looking over at me.</p> <p>"Black and white, actually. More white, though. And not too puffy."</p> <p>Jessie nodded thoughtfully. "Well, come on!" She went through the room until we came to another door.</p> <p>She kept leading us through doors, making me wonder how big this actual store was. In this room though, the dresses were black and white. Wait a second, she had a room for every colour?!</p> <p>"Yes, I do. Cool huh?" asked Jessie, examining a dress. I looked at her. How did she know what I was thinking?</p> <p>"Oh, I can read minds. Do you have any abilities?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I can control the four elements," I told her.</p> <p>"Really? Omg, how cool! Okay, try this on." She pushed me in the dressing room with a dress.</p> <p>Rosalie and Alice parked themselves on the couch and waited until I walked out. </p> <p>"Hmm... too much black." said Alice.</p> <p>"Yeah, I thought so too. Try this one." But none of the dresses seemed to appeal to me.</p> <p>And so it went, until I got tired of seeing the same dresses over and over. </p> <p>"You were always so picky, but somehow, you always found the perfect item for whatever you were looking for," said Alice, giving me a lopsided smile.</p> <p>"Okay, I just need to look around again. I feel as though it's here, I just need to find it. Give me a minute," I told them, rubbing my temples. I usually don't know what I'm looking for till I see it.</p> <p>I went through the rack, then went deeper in the room. I walked along, barely sparing a glance at the dresses. Until I saw a little piece of one poking out.</p> <p>Walking up to it, I ran my hand along the material until I came to the hanger. It was hard to tell which was which. I pulled  it out and looked at it.</p> <p>It was gorgeous, but I still had to try it on to be sure it was the one I wanted.</p> <p>I slipped into the dressing room, leaving Alice, Rosalie and Jessie outside chatting about the dresses.</p> <p>I took it off the hanger and held it up. A small smile came on my face and I slipped it on. It was perfect. I loved it.</p> <p>Like I said, I don't know what I'm looking for till I see it. I stepped out of the dressing room.</p> <p>Jessie was the first to see me. "My dear, you look beautiful!" she exclaimed. Alice's and Rosalie's head shot over to me.</p> <p>They walked over to me, mouths opened. "This is the one," said Rose, after walking all around me. Alice nodded her approval, a big smile on her face.</p> <p>I checked the price tag and my eyes nearly popped. Two thousand five hundred dollars?!  "Oh don't you worry about that, we're paying for everything," said Alice, whipping out a credit card.</p> <p>I began to protest, but Rosalie stopped me. "We want to Kat. Please." I sighed in defeat. But hey, I wasn't mad!</p> <p>"Well, I do get a lot of business here. I'm sure taking off a thousand wouldn't hurt," said Jessie smiling at us.</p> <p>I thanked her, and went in to take off the dress. Jessie recommended a shoe store for us, and off we went again. Turns out the cab driver is really nice.</p> <p>He asked me if I got what I was looking for and congratulated me on the engagement.</p> <p>Rosalie chose a pair of shoes that I loved right away. They were silver heels, and looked gorgeous.</p> <p>"Okay, so I'll do your nails, Rosalie will do your makeup and we'll both do your hair, kay?"</p> <p>I nodded. I trusted them more than some hair stylist. "Guys, you will be my bridesmaids, right?"</p> <p>"Are you kidding? You don't know how long we've been waiting for you to ask!" exclaimed Alice.</p> <p>"She's right, I was starting to get a little worried," admitted Rose.</p> <p>"Okay, so you, Alice, Leah, Esme and Emily. I already know what your dresses are going to look like."</p> <p>"You sketch it out when we get back to the hotel Esme can make them, she's good at that stuff."</p> <p>We were back at the hotel soon. I told them the dresses were going to be simple, with any shoes they think will match.</p> <p>It was a simple, strapless white dress, with a black sash around the middle. They liked it a lot, but Rosalie decided they should tie in the front, a little to the side, instead of back.</p> <p>"You'll see. Trust me," she said.</p> <p>I ended up going to sleep, with only a few hours left really, I just wanted to sleep because the bed was so big and high, and the room was freezing cold.</p> <p>It was Rosalie who decided to do everything early, saying how things could really pile up if you leave it last minute.</p> <p>I left Rosalie and Alice deciding what hairstyle and how to do my nails.</p> <p>Getting married. So exciting!<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>I woke up wrapped in Edward's arms in my room. I sat up quickly. "Woah, where am I? I'm supposed to be in New York!"</p> <p>He chuckled, stroking my hair. "You were completely knocked out, love. Looks like all those dresses wore you out more than you think. Rosalie brought you up here because she was too lazy to take you to your room."</p> <p>"Oh." I didn't think I was that tired. </p> <p>"So, speaking of dresses, what's your look like?" he asked me curiously.</p> <p>"Well, it's white with- hey! I can't tell you! You'll just have to see," I said, narrowing my eyes at him.</p> <p>Edward gave a pained groan. "Please! Alice won't tell me, Rosalie shoved me out of the room, Esme said no, I even called Leah and Emily!"</p> <p>"It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding, and you should be ashamed of yourself taking advantage of my knowledge when I now woke up," I scolded him.</p> <p>"I'm sorry sweetheart, it's just I want to know badly!" he begged. Edward took my hands. "Please?"</p> <p>"No. Now go, I'm going to get changed," I said, shooing him out the room.</p> <p>"Do I have to leave?" he asked, giving me a smirk.</p> <p>If I were human, my cheeks would be red. "Go!"</p> <p>Edward snickered and disappeared downstairs. I shut the door and put myself in the shower. I got out after about fifteen minutes, put on some decent clothes, and went downstairs.</p> <p>At least, I <em>tried</em> to go downstairs. Rosalie stopped me before I even reached the flight. "Here, hide this!"</p> <p>She shoved the bag with the dress in it. "I had to hide it from Edward, telling him I had 'lady items' in it when he tried to look." Rose shuddered.</p> <p>Just then Alice walked out. "Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Go eat something, you were practically dead yesterday. Rose, make her something to eat, then come to my room. We have things we still need to sort out."</p> <p>Alice vanished. "Well come on. I thought we killed you yesterday when you refused to wake up." She led me down the stairs.</p> <p>Soon, I was munching on a chicken sandwich watching Spongebob. "I don't get why you like this show. It's stupid, with a little gay sponge as the main character," Rosalie commented, rolling her eyes.</p> <p>"Okay, number one, Spongebob is not gay. He's a drawing for crying out loud! And I just like it." Thta's something I never understood. It's animated! How could a cartoon be gay?</p> <p>I finished my sandwich, put the dish in the dishwasher and Rose and I walked up to Alice's room.</p> <p>The door was open before we even knocked. "Okay, Kat, here's a book with a bunch of photos of nail designs. Choose the one you like."</p> <p>I reached for the book which lay open on the bed, but she stopped me. "But no time for that! First, you have to look at the invitations! Edward and Jasper worked on them, anything you don't like or want to change tell Rosalie, and she'll fix it."</p> <p>I glanced around at Rose who already had her seat at Alice's computer and had the invite on the screen. I walked over and looked at it, taking in every detail. I nodded. "It's perfect, don't change anything."</p> <p>She nodded. "Okay, when you finished looking at the nails, there's another book with hairstyles. Look at that too."</p> <p>I nodded again. "Oh and, you guys do realize we still have more than three weeks left right?" The girls giggled.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p><strong>-One week later-</strong></p> <p>I let out a loud groan. "Don't worry sweet, we'll find somewhere," Edward tried to comfort me. We sat in his room, looking over a map of Forks.</p> <p>For the past week, we have been searching for a place for the wedding reception. And everywhere was terrible. All the rooms were too small!</p> <p>I know Forks is a small place. I know the population is not much. But I remember looking at a place, and a pizza box was easily larger than it. "Okay, Kat, look. We haven't checked this area of Forks yet," Edward said encouragingly. He pushed a map towards me.</p> <p>I never saw it, because I was too busy moping into a pillow. He grabbed my arm and yanked me up, which no doubt would have dislocated a human's arm.</p> <p>I was so disappointed that I just held the map in front of me, and catapulted forward.</p> <p>I ended up on the ground, with my face in the map, my butt in the air and me groaning about unfair life was. There was only so much disappointment a girl could take.</p> <p> Edward knelt on the ground, eased me up until i was kneeling as well and pointed out a place on the map. I looked at him.</p> <p>"We haven't checked there because that's where the rubbish dump is! It stinks there! HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW THAT!" I screamed in his face. Then I crossed my legs and arms, pouted and frowned at the floor, as though it was the reason for all of this.</p> <p>I was pretty surprised he hadn't called off the marriage, I was like this for the past two days.</p> <p>"Not there Kat. Look where I'm pointing," he said patiently. I dragged my eyes to it.</p> <p>My sour mood disappeared. "Hey, let's go there!" I exclaimed.</p> <p>Edward took my face into his hands. "How do I put up with you?" he asked, shaking his head smiling, before pressing a quick kiss to my lips.</p> <p>I grinned. "Well, come on." Edward was standing suddenly, and helped me up. He went to start the car, and I went to tell Esme where we were going.</p> <p>She wished us luck, and we disappeared, Rosalie already in the car. Rose was actually a pretty good interior designer, considering she did my room, so we asked her to come with us and look around.</p> <p>We were at the place in practically minutes, it was a wonder he never got a speeding ticket before. The whole ride, Rosalie blamed herself for not thinking of here before.</p> <p>"I swear, this part has places larger than a credit card, unlike most. I know a few places that you might like. Take a right here, Ed," she directed.</p> <p>Edward stopped in front of a decent looking place. A little shabby if you looked hard, but you'll be amazed at what an interior designer could do. Rose wasn't a professional, but she was what we had.</p> <p>Rosalie had our best interests at heart, so I trusted her rather than have to explain in detail to another designer.</p> <p>The room was a good size, but I didn't like it too much. There was no air condition, a complete setback for me. And there weren't any windows either. People would fry! Well, actually they wouldn't, because there was no body heat, other than the pack, and Forks didn't get that much sun.</p> <p>But no air condition? Tough luck managers, no sale today. Edward drove to another place at Rosalie's directions, and this place looked as though it had some pizzaz. (Got that from Spongebob (: )</p> <p>Debra's, it was called. Plain and simple. Well, we met Debra, who turned out to be a sucker for weddings, and was willing to knock down the price by a thousand for us.</p> <p>We refused though. She said it without us even asking the price, but we decided to pay it. The full price, which was pretty expensive, but Edward assured me he wanted to. I could see why, though.</p> <p>It looked as though Debra put all her savings into a place that didn't get much business, and she wore plain clothes, which looked a little worn.</p> <p>I was glad he did. I took a liking to Debra, but, sadly, Edward advised against any humans coming. Some covens might have some newborns, and a single human with a load of vampires was not safe.</p> <p>Too bad, I wanted to invite her. She was old, and her face had that kind, grandmother look to it.</p> <p>But she seemed completely happy by renting it out to us alone. Rosalie approved of it, there was air condition, and it was huge. Large enough to fill even more than the amount of guests we had.</p> <p>Rosalie snapped a few pictures with her phone, after Edward told Alice would most likely kill her if she didn't.</p> <p>We left after checking the parking lot, which was large enough for the cars to fit. Edward drove back to the house in minutes, once again.</p> <p>It was about about eight o' clock, but I felt kind of tired. I hadn't slept the whole week. I kissed Edward goodnight, left him going over designs with Rosalie, and went up to my room.</p> <p>I lay down on my bed, and was ready to fall asleep, when I thought what would happen if I tripped up the aisle or something? Or what if something goes wrong?</p> <p>I started to feel nervous. I sat up in bed and sighed. I needed to talk to someone.</p> <p>I left my room, not bothering to pull anything over my nightgown, I wasn't going downstairs anyway. I padded around the corners and knocked softly on Carlisle and Esme's room.</p> <p>"Come in," Esme's singsong voice rang out. I gently pushed the door open. "Oh, hello Kat. Is something wrong?" A crease of concern lined her forehead.</p> <p>"I was just wondering if I could talk to you for a little while," I asked. Carlisle sat on the bed, reading a book. He got up and left the room, understandingly.</p> <p>Esme got up from her seat at the dresser and sat on the bed, patting the space next to her. "Come, sit."</p> <p>I sat and began slowly. "The wedding--"</p> <p>She didn't let me finish. "Getting nervous? Like tripping down the aisle? Accidentally staining your dress? Trust me dear, it's expected."</p> <p>I stopped, relieved that I didn't have to explain.</p> <p>"I felt the same way on my wedding day. I didn't even try to calm myself down. I made it up the aisle, but the worst thing happened to me. Of course, I can laugh about it now, but let me tell you, it was terrifying."</p> <p>"What happened?" I asked curiously.</p> <p>She gave a small laugh. "I was so nervous, the nerves took over. When it was time for us to say 'I do', I acidentally said 'I don't'!"</p> <p>I cupped my hand to my mouth, a smile on my face. "Really?"</p> <p>Esme was full out laughing now. "Oh yes. I realized my mistake and hurriedly fixed it, but Carlisle looked as though he was about to have a heart attack."</p> <p>I giggled. We talked a bit more. Esme told me the best thing to do was to just keep my eyes on Edward. She gave the same piece of advice to Rosalie and Alice on their wedding days as well.</p> <p>After about half of an hour, I left, feeling pretty good with myself. I opened my window and took a breath of fresh air, before I went back in bed.</p> <p>I fell asleep soon, no longer worried about the wedding.</p> <p>Guess I don't have a contribution to one of those funny wedding videos on Youtube. And I had to remember not to watch those anymore.</p> <p>When you're getting married, those things are like horror movies.<p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p><strong>-One week later----again-</strong></p> <p>For the past week, Edward and I helped Rosalie get an idea of decoration for the reception. We decided not to go with the whole black and white theme there, and mixed some purple with it.</p> <p>It looked amazing. Well, sounded amazing. Esme and I now sat in the kitchen, going over the menu.</p> <p>I already arranged a seating arrangement. All the Cullens would be up at the table with me. The pack would get three tables in the front, and the rest of vampires would sit with their covens. The names of their coven would be on the table. It was late, about nine o' clock.</p> <p>"So, for the vampires, rare steak. And for the pack is steak, cooked steak. Right?" Esme verified.</p> <p>"Right."</p> <p>"And there will be Emmett's wine for the vampires, and normal wine for the pack. Three bottles per table. Right?"</p> <p>"Right."</p> <p>"And after we eat and cut the cake and everything, we push back the tables and the dancing starts, right?"</p> <p>"Right."</p> <p>"Then we fly up to the moon and pretend we're carrots. Right?"</p> <p>"Ri- wait, what?"</p> <p>Esme laughed. "Just checking to see if you were paying attention. Okay, so you go see Jasper, he's putting together the programme."</p> <p>I nodded, plucking an apple out of the fruit basket. "See ya later."</p> <p>I walked up to his room. The door was ajar, and he sat typing on the computer. I went quietly as close to the door as I could, then shoved it open and yelled, "Boo!"</p> <p>He didn't even flinch.</p> <p>"Come on dude, I was perfecly quiet this time!" I whined.</p> <p>"I could smell you," Jasper replied, flashing a sideways grin to me.</p> <p>I groaned. "Okay, so let's see that programme."</p> <p>"Okay, first you're gonna do all the toasts, first two by Sam and Carlisle, then a dance item."</p> <p>I nodded. "Go on."</p> <p>"Then the other toasts by Alice, Leah and Emmett. Then another dance item."</p> <p>"In that order?" I questioned.</p> <p>"Well, it's actually Leah, then Emmett and Alice," Jasper said, reading over the list.</p> <p>"Okay, keep going."</p> <p>"Edward speaks, then we serve dinner, First Dance, cut the cake, then everyone can do what they want," said Jasper.</p> <p>"Put cutting the cake before the First Dance," I directed.</p> <p>Jasper typed something on his computer. "Done. Now come look at the design."</p> <p>I finished off my apple, and ran my eyes over the design. "That looks pretty good. Thanks Jass," I said, walking out the door.</p> <p>I walked over to Edward's room and tapped gently on the door. He opened it. "Kat, come here," he greeted me, pulling me into his arms.</p> <p>"I feel as though I haven't seen you in so long," he murmured into my hair.</p> <p>I laughed. "Strangely, I feel the same way."</p> <p>Edward pulled away and led me over to the couch. He sat down, pulled me on his lap, and began kissing my neck. "The wedding plans are good?"</p> <p>"Hmm? Oh, sure...mmmm," I said, distracted by his lips on my neck.</p> <p>He sucked hard, and I felt his fangs come out. Gently, he bit into my neck. I wasn't scared, I trusted him. I gasped at first, but the pain eased after a while. He drank some of my blood, before pulling away and licking the pierced skin to heal it.</p> <p>"Sorry, I just wanted to taste it," he said, a drop of blood on his lip. </p> <p>"That's okay," I said, wiping it away. He pressed his mouth to mine, and began kissing me passionately, hungrily, as though he was yearning for this for years.</p> <p>I returned it, feeling the same way he did. Edward lifted me up and rearranged me on his lap, so my legs were on either side of his torso. I wrapped my arms around his neck, and he left my lips and went down to my neck again. I tilted back my head and let out a moan. He kissed up and down my neck, sucking at random places, before returning to my lips. He gently slid his tongue in my mouth and explored. Edward lifted me up and lay me down on the couch, supporting his weight on his hands so he would not crush me. I don't know how long we kissed, but it ended all too soon.</p> <p>Edward somehow managed to flip us over, so he was at the bottom and I was on top, and pulled me down to his chest, stroking my hair. "I love you, sweetheart," he whispered in my ear.</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>I fell asleep like that, and when I woke up I was in my bed, with Edward laying next to me, looking at my head intently.</p> <p>"There wasn't enough room on the couch, so I brought you here. Now go to sleep, that dream was interesting," he said.</p> <p>"You know I can't actually continue a dream right?" I mumbled, already drifting asleep again.</p> <p>"You can try," he whispered. I shook my head and rolled over, back in Dreamland.<p><strong>I know I'm skipping a lot of time, but there's not really anything happening, and I just want to get to the wedding, now GO READ!!</strong></p> <p><strong>Her wedding stuff over there! --------&gt;</strong></p> <p><strong>______________________________________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>-----Two weeks later-----</strong></p> <p><strong>Katherine's POV</strong></p> <p>This is it.</p> <p>This is it!</p> <p>THIS IS IT!!!</p> <p>AAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!</p> <p>As you can tell, I am freaking out. Here I am, sitting in Alice's spinning chair at ten o' clock in the morning letting her do my hair.</p> <p>The wedding was today!</p> <p>Leah was out helping Esme and Emily with the food and setting up of tables and things like that, and Rosalie was examining the dress, scrutinizing every thread to make sure it was perfect.</p> <p>Occasionally, a huge, happy goofy grin would come on my face and make Alice tell me to <em>keep still or else I'll look like a clown.</em></p> <p><em><br/></em>Rosalie smoothed out more of the dress and made sure none of the sequins were coming out, then pulled up a chair and sat down next to me, examining my nails which Alice did last night.</p> <p>"Good job Alice, one of your best," she commented, bringing my hand closer to her eyes for a better look.</p> <p>"Mm," she murmured. Apparently, she was afraid she would lose concentration, and refused to make more than cavemen sounds.</p> <p>For the rest of the time, Rosalie and I talked away, she told me about her wedding, all the crazy things running through her head that might have happened, then it turned out perfect.</p> <p>I mean, sure, your wedding day is huge. But you can't help but worry about falling or tripping or stuff like that.</p> <p>If it wasn't for Esme, I'd probably be losing my mind now. </p> <p>Alice finished a little after eleven, which was pretty early for her. I couldn't see myself, because they papered up the mirrors just like last time when they were getting me ready for my date with Edward.</p> <p>"The lipstick will go on at the last minute, I don't want you to put on the dress and anything happens," she told me, putting away all the makeup items.</p> <p>"Rose, you take over."</p> <p>"Finally," she muttered. Rosalie kept talking away, doing the hairstyle as though it was second nature to her.</p> <p>Which it probably was.</p> <p>I don't know what time she finished, because my phone died, and Alice didn't have a clock in her room.</p> <p>I saw locks of hair that were a little wavy-curled sort of way. Looked pretty cool, and I liked it. Even though I couldn't see much of it.</p> <p>Alice sat on the bed, making up my bouquet. White and black flowers, to match my dress. I swear, these Cullens seemed to be good at everything.</p> <p>And I'm gonna be one soon! I unexpectedly let out a squeal of the happiness and joy that suddenly overwhelmed me.</p> <p>Alice giggled. "You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that."</p> <p>I smiled, and sighed with joy, thinking of how happy I was at that moment. "Okay, so go put on your bridesmaids dresses! I wanna see you in them!" I begged, springing from the chair and clapping my hands.</p> <p>They groaned playfully and took the hangers and slipped into the dresses. "We don't have that long again, so why not?" asked Rose, tying the sash around her waist and pulling it to the side, then did the same to Alice's.</p> <p>My eyebrows raised as I took them in. The dresses looked amazing, and Rosalie was right, they did look better at the side.</p> <p>After I ate a chicken sandwich, it was about half past twelve. The wedding started at two o' clock. Rosalie, Alice and I just talked until it was one, then they helped me into the dress.</p> <p>I slipped off the cotton robe I wore and let them zip it up. "Here you go." Alice handed me a garter. </p> <p>I smiled and slipped it on, then Alice and Rosalie did my shoes, after an argument about if I bent over it would crease the dress.</p> <p> A knock on the door startled us. Alice flashed over to the door and pressed herself against it, pressing most of her strength on the door to keep it closed in case it was Edward trying to get in.</p> <p>"Who is it?" she sang.</p> <p>"Superman!" cried a voice.</p> <p>"Oh no," said Rosalie, holding her head in her hands. Alice opened the door and Jasper and Emmett entered the room, Emmett thankfully not wearing a Superman costume.</p> <p>"Wow Kat, you look stunning! You girls did an amazing job," commented Jasper, taking me in.</p> <p>Emmett nodded vigorously. Alice and Rosalie beamed with pride. Jasper and Emmett both complimented their mates, then left.</p> <p>"Wait! Why did you come here? No offense," Alice shouted, sprinting to the door.</p> <p>"We were bored!" shouted back Jasper.</p> <p>"And now they're probably going to drink eight bottles of alcohol because they were BORED. Thank God Jasper's responsible," said Rosalie,rolling her eyes.</p> <p>Alice lauged gaily and waved her off. "They're right though Kat. You're a vision!" she exclaimed.</p> <p>"You look beautiful," said Rosalie, her cheeks flushed. </p> <p>"All thanks to you," I told them. "Can I see myself now?" I asked pleadingly.</p> <p>"Wait, just let me put on the lipstick... aaaand.... DONE! Now go look."</p> <p>I walked over to the floor length mirror and tore off the paper. I gasped when I saw myself. I never thought I could look like this.</p> <p>Ever.</p> <p>They really did do a good job. A smile came on my face. "Now don't you start crying now, because that mascara is NOT waterproof," Alice told me sternly.</p> <p>"We can do the crying for you," she added, squeezing my shoulders.</p> <p>Rosalie checked her phone. "Oh! Time to go! Leah's already there, and Emmett and Jasper cleared a path for the car to get through the forest. Let's go!"</p> <p>I went down the stairs carefully, and stepped into the car, which was decorated in flowers. Rosalie and Alice rode in another car that drove closely behind us.</p> <p>By the time we got there, it was just before two. There was ton of people there. All extremely beautiful.</p> <p>A tall, striking strawberry blond stood out in the crowd, I guessed it was Tanya. I pulled my head away from the window.</p> <p>Leaning back on the seat, I took a deep breath.</p> <p>Carlisle opened the door and gave me his hand to help me out. I got out carefully, not wanting to pull my dress on anything.</p> <p>He held out his arm to me, smiling. "You look wonderful Katherine," he whispered.</p> <p>I smiled my thanks and together, we began walking up the aisle.<p><strong>Katherines POV</strong></p> <p>We began to walk up the aisle, slowly in time to the <em>extremely slow</em> music. Yeah, I know its my wedding, but who chose the song for the first wedding?</p> <p>And why did it have to be the same for all weddings?</p> <p>I kept a smile on my face, which was easy, and looked around at the congregation.</p> <p>Everyone was smiling at me, which was nice, but creepy. They all had smiles, but some didnt look genuine, mostly belonging to the girls.</p> <p>The strawberry blond, Tanya, her smile was pasted on, but it looked cold. I took my glance away from her. I never met her! How could she not like me?</p> <p>Or was it because of the person I was marrying? I waved the thought from my mind.</p> <p>I looked around at the others. They were all young, all the same age since they were turned, but could see some of the older ones.</p> <p>They looked more experienced, genuinely happy, and had a motherly look, like Esme.</p> <p>Finally, I looked at Edward. He stood there, looking perfect as ever, smiling at me. For no reason, I felt embarrassed. </p> <p>The aisle was pretty long, so I took my time, taking in everyone. Emmett gave me a huge thumbs up, and Jasper nodded to me, smiling.</p> <p>Leah was looking at me in awe, and Alice and Rosalie looked as though they would burst into tears. I felt as though I would myself.</p> <p>Esme took me in proudly, as did Emily, and the entire pack looked happy. Seth and Embry had tears in their eyes, and Jacob, was, well, doing a look only Jacob can do.</p> <p>Sam didnt have any emotion on his face, but when he saw me looking at him, he nodded. I nodded discreetly back.</p> <p>It was his way of saying he approved. The whole pack looked rather uncomfortable though, guess the scent was too much for them.</p> <p>Suddenly, I felt Carlisle let go of my arm. I looked at him in surprise, until I realized wed reached the end of the aisle.</p> <p>Oh, silly me.</p> <p>I took Edwards outstretched hand and let him take me next to him. The minister started the ceremony.</p> <p>Dearly beloved, we have gathered here today to celebrate I stopped paying attention at there, considering I knew what he would say already.</p> <p>Im not going to lie, this was my wedding and it was supposed to be amazing and special for us.</p> <p>But this was extremely boring.</p> <p>All the minister did was rant on and on about how special young love is. It felt like an hour before he got to the vows.</p> <p>Edward looked as though he was trying to hold in laughter. Dude was probably reading my mind.</p> <p>I <em>am</em> pretty hilarious.</p> <p>I began paying attention at the vows. Soon, they got to the I do part.</p> <p>Edward said his firmly and happily, and I mirrored him.</p> <p>You may now kiss the bride, said the minister.</p> <p>He pulled me swiftly to him and pressed a passionate kiss to my lips, which I returned. I didnt want it to end, but we were in front of an audience.</p> <p>Edward and I pulled away gently, and turned to everyone.</p> <p>I now present Mr. and Mrs. Cullen, the minister announced.<p><strong>Well, finished!
