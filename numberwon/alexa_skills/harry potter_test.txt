Gripped tightly in Jean's left hand were her husband's soft fingers.  Her right hand was in her mouth, the nails being chewed off bit by bit from nerves.  
Jean Granger dreaded every bump on the road, every stoplight and word on the radio.  Eventually she turned off the noise box and took to staring out of the rain-flecked window.
A smile flickering at his wife's nerves, Wilfred Granger assumed his most calming voice.  "I'm sure it's nothing bad, hun.  They probably want to tell us we've got the next Einstein on our hands!"  He chuckled at his own joke, but Jean's nerves were not calm.
On Monday, after lunch, the Granger residence had received a call from a very strict woman with a voice that snapped like chalk.  The conversation replayed over and over in Jean's mind.
 "Good afternoon, am I speaking to a parent or guardian of Hermione Granger?"
 "Yes, this is her mother, Jean. What's the matter?"  Jean twirled the springy phone cord, wondering if her worst fears had been realized.
"This is Headmistress Swick of Somerset Oaks Academy.  I was wondering if you would like to join me for tea this Thursday to discuss your daughter's...academics."
 Jean was too smart of a woman to look over the pause and stress in the woman's voice.  Why was the meeting so important that the phone call needed to be made by the Headmistress instead of a lowly secretary?
"Is there any problem? Are you disappointed in Hermione?"
"Disappointed? Oh, heavens, no. I just fancy a chat. Can we guarantee your appointment, Mrs. Granger?"
"Yes, of course." 
Upon hanging up, Jean had sunk into a state of nerves from which she had failed to re-emerge all week. Today, Thursday, was the fated day of the appointment.
Prophesied and fretted about by Hermione's mother for half of a decade, Jean's worst fears finally seemed to crop themselves up.  They would wrap their sticky tendrils around her neck and work their way up to the dome of her head.  The fears would then sink through her skull like a ghost, enter her brain and take charge of her actions and thoughts, until nothing of joy remained in her life.  All because it seemed as though the Headmistress had finally discovered what Jean had realized in the first five years of Hermione's life.
Strange things always happened around Hermione. Inexplicable, moderately catastrophic things.
Once, the little girl lost her favorite ballerina doll. She saw a girl in the supermarket holding a similar doll, and began to cry. The other girl's doll's head fell off as if severed by an ax, and two little girls were now crying in the store. Jean rushed her daughter out, confused but not yet suspicious as to what had happened, for it was impossible that Hermione could have anything to do with the situation.  The thought hadn't even entered Jean's head.
Then, last year, Hermione wanted a certain piece of candy. It was the week after Halloween and Hermione had already eaten more candy than Jean thought could fit into that little body.  Her mother refused to buy it and insisted they leave the grocery store.  Hermione compromised, but not without the candy rack falling apart once they reached the door.
At dinner, merely weeks ago, Hermione was becoming impatient because she wanted to go to her room and read a new book she'd gotten from the library.  However, Jean and Wilfred wouldn't let her leave until she had finished eating her cauliflower.  Hermione's face had turned red, and she'd crossed her arms.  An instant later, the hot sauce bottle exploded.
Now, these things may have all been coincidental. However, Jean suspected something more. She couldn't explain it, but could sense it.
Jean's only hope was that Hermione's teachers and school friends would not think she was strange and would accept her for who she was. Now, however...It seemed as though the Headmistress had finally noticed something out of order, and she did not seem to like it one bit.Hermione could hear huffing, frustrated voices.  Her parents fought often, but none more so than this week.  She shut her eyes in an attempt to block out the noise, but the walls were thin.  She had been having a nice dream until the voices woke her up.
Tiptoeing across the navy blue floor decorated with gold stars and a silver moon, Hermione snuck out and went to listen at her parents' door.
"We can't send her to secondary school, Jean. She'll get picked on by all the other kids! None of them will appreciate her."
"You don't know that!" Hermione's mother snapped back. "She hasn't got any friends, I hate to see her like this. I want her to have fun, to be a normal child. We can't homeschool her forever."
 "So you want to have another Headmistress Swick on our hands, complaining about Hermione and declaring that she's mentally ill?"
Frozen with her ear to the door, Hermione tried to control her breathing. She had heard her parents talk like this before, but never voicing the opinion that there was something wrong with her. She might be different from other children, but there was certainly nothing mentally amiss with her.
Or was there?  There were times she wasn't sure...
"Hermione is loads better!" Jean yelled, barely attempting to keep her voice down now. "She hasn't done anything strange for years."
"Is that so? What about that nail polish incident the other day?"  WIlfred challenged his wife.
"That couldn’t have possibly been Hermione!"
Just two days before, Hermione had been caught putting on her mother's make-up. Jean had started to berate her, when all of the nail polish bottles exploded, sending polish flying everywhere.  Jean still hadn't managed to clean off all the red, blue, and silver paint from the mirror, chairs and walls in the bedroom she shared with Wilfred.  All Hermione could remember was being extremely angry, and she insisted to her parents that she hadn't even touched the nail polish.  But strange things just happened around her whenever she was mad or sad.  It wasn't as if she could control it.
"Maybe not, but that's not the only weird thing that's happened with her! What about the kid across the street that Hermione used to like?  Remember what happened when he said he wouldn't kiss her on the cheek?  His lips sprouted fungus!  And might I remind you, Jean-"
"I would appreciate it if you would stop accusing Hermione of these atrocities simply because they occur in her vicinity."
Hermione, meanwhile, on the other side of the door, had had enough. She was tired of hearing her parents fight over her. The next words out of her mother's mouth sent Hermione over the edge.
"Maybe we should take her to the hospital, but just to make sure. If the doctor says everything is okay with her, we'll start looking at secondary schools."
Slam! - the bedroom door was blown to shreds and Hermione stood in the doorway, shaking with fury. "I do not need to go to the hospital!" she shouted.
"Hermione!" Wilfred said, stepping back in shock from his teary-eyed, red-faced daughter.
"There's nothing wrong with me! Why don't you believe me?"  Hermione's bushy, frizzy hair seemed to spark with indescribable rage.
"Hermione, you just blew up the door! If you would stop doing things like that, we wouldn't have to take you to the hospital."
"I am not going to the hospital!" Hermione protested, unable to believe what was happening. They couldn't do this to her. It was wrong. "I can't control it if I'm different from everyone else.  There's nothing I can do about it!"The next few weeks could have been spent doing so many more productive activities, but Hermione simply could not bring herself to look up from her booklist or the Hogwarts letter.  While wary herself of the possibility that the letter was fake, she still could not contain her excitement at the idea of making friends and learning magic.
Hermione always knew something was different about her.  While unable to believe that she caused so many terrible incidents in her life, she could remember feeling mad or sad at all of these moments.  Perhaps the anger or sadness, in such a concentrated dose, was what brought out the magic in her?
She also knew that as an eleven-year-old girl without any friends, her chances of making any in the non-magical world in the future were slim.  There were a few times when she thought that someone wanted to befriend her, but the attempt always failed.  They thought she was too smart, ugly, and weird to be a friend.
But at a school where everyone could do magic?  It would be a whole new world to Hermione, one where she could meet people who were just as "weird" as she was!  She could hardly wait.
Hermione sniffed the beautiful parchment; it was becoming one of her most favorite scents, just after freshly mowed grass.  The beautifully scripted green letters called out to her, begging to take her to a magical world, far away from these judgmental - what had the letter called them?  Muggles!
    ~~~
The twelfth of August dawned bright and warm.  The sun came out, the birds sang, and Hermione hummed as she tied the bows on her shiny black shoes.  Today was the day!
Or at least she hoped.
Wilfred and Jean combed their hair nervously, straightened their shirts without end, and constantly looked out of the window.  Hermione wished they wouldn't; it only further fermented her fear that the representative of Hogwarts would not come.
The letter did not say what time the representative would arrive, so Hermione was prepared to wait all day, if that was what it took.
After lunch, the Grangers retreated to a quiet reading session in the living room.  But Jean's eyes stayed fixed on the page in her novel, Wilfred sighed as he ruffled his newspaper, and Hermione couldn't absorb one word of her Hogwarts letter. Silent they remained; it was as though speaking about the possibility would jinx it.  The minutes passed, and the Granger family  began to yawn, with stiff backs and faltering hopes.
Then at noon, at long last, the doorbell rang!  Hermione stood between her parents when they opened the door.  How silly they would look if it was just the mailman, or a neighbor!
On the threshold stood a tall, strict-looking woman, with black hair wound up in an incredibly tight bun.  She wore long, emerald green robes that glittered strangely in the sunlight.  On her head stood a tall, pointed black hat.  A witch's hat!
Hermione's parents looked skeptical, but Hermione hurried to greet the witch.  "I'm so pleased to meet you!  My name is Hermione Granger."
The witch smiled down at her with a kind but reserved face.  "I'm pleased to meet you as well, Miss Granger.  I am Professor McGonagall, and I will be your Transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts."
"Transigation?" asked Wilfred.  "What's that?"
Professor McGonagall nodded and said, "Shall we continue this conversation indoors?  Muggles, that is to say, non-magical people, are not to know about the wizarding world.  If we talk so openly on your doorstep, I fear the secret may be lost."
"Why are they - I mean we, not allowed to know?" Jean asked curiously, showing the professor to a seat in the living room.
"Wizards are safer when hidden away.  Otherwise, muggles will want answers to all of their problems that can only be fixed with magic.  Also, there is the possibility they will persecute us for being different.""I am ready," spoke Hermione to her closet mirror.  "I am Hermione Granger, and I am a witch.  I will learn every spell there is to learn and I will not be ridiculed any longer!  I am a witch who will have witch and wizard friends."
She crossed a chopstick - from the Chinese dinner her mother had cooked the day before - in front of her chest like a sword.
"Abra Kadabra!  Boom!" Hermione pretended to fall back from the bang of her unknown spell.  She looked all around, ready to fight any enemies.  She then stood in front of the mirror once more and put on her best, polite smile.  "Good afternoon, Professor Dumbledore!  As you can see, I've successfully cleared Hogwarts of any enemies.  For I am good witch Hermione Granger, wielder of wand and defeater of evil-doers.  I'd like to stay and chat, but I need to get to Diagon Alley."
With that, she tucked her chopstick in the inside pocket of her blazer and left the room.  Before shutting the door behind her, Hermione glanced at the stars and moons that decorated her dark blue room, thinking how she'd always wanted to reach the skies with her dreams and be something different.  It seemed she would finally achieve that wish.
Hermione's bushy brown hair bounced on her shoulders as she took the stairs two at a time to meet her parents and Minerva McGonagall, who all waited patiently for her at the front door.
It had been a week after their first meeting with the Transfiguration professor, and Hermione was more than eager to get her witch shopping done.  Her father's bag was full of muggle money, which they would exchange for wizard money at Gringotts Bank.  Professor McGonagall had told Hermione many things about Diagon Alley, all of which she greedily memorized.
For example, Hermione already knew the way to Charing Cross Road by heart after looking up the directions on her father's computer.  The car jerked its frustrated way across potholes, but that could not deter Hermione's spirit.  Professor McGonagall sat in the front seat directing Wilfred.
Hermione did not know what the Leaky Cauldron might look like, but she knew that muggles couldn't see it.  However, that was only because they did not know it was there.  It must be believed in to be entered.  One must know that beyond any doubt, the Leaky Cauldron will exist.  In this way, Hermione's parents would be able to enter Diagon Alley with her.
After parking, the Grangers and Professor McGonagall walked across the road and up to an old building that looked like a run-down pub.  The muggles walking along the road glanced over it because they could only see the shops on either side.
Inside, however, were many lively people, all dressed in long robes like Professor McGonagall.  The bartender, toothless and bald, greeted them merrily as they shut the door behind them.  Witches watched their progress, and wizards with tall, pointed hats nodded to the Grangers.  They walked through the bar and followed Professor McGonagall to a back alley, where there was nothing but a dumpster and a brick wall.  
The professor glanced around furtively before pulling out her wand and counting the bricks above the dumpster.  A certain brick seemed to fancy her, and she tapped it three times with her wand.
Immediately, the bricks moved aside and an entryway formed.  Hermione gasped at what lay beyond it; miles upon miles of bustling shops and a cobblestone pathway, filled with witches and wizards!
Hundreds of multi-colored owls hooted from one store, another store sold unicorn horns, and a third advertised broomsticks that could fly!  Hermione stared in the windows of the bookshop they passed, Flourish and Blotts.  She wanted nothing more than to enter it and get as many books as possible to help her learn about magic.  However, she first needed to go to the bank and get muggle money exchanged for wizard money.Only one week remained.  Seven glowing stars, previously taped in random locations on Hermione's ceiling, were now lined up on her headboard.  Each star represented a day left before she boarded the Hogwarts Express.
"Take deep breaths, Hermione," she told herself, trying to calm her nerves.
Really, she shouldn't have anything to worry about; she learned mostly everything she would need to know.  She'd locked herself in her room and read each textbook at least seven times each.  Her eyes were blood-shot, but her head was full of magnificent, new information.
The International State of Wizarding Secrecy was established in 1692, saying that wizards and muggles needed to be separated...Hogwarts had four founders: Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin...Powdered root of asphodel and an infusion of wormwood would help to create the Draught of the Living Dead potion...The spell Alohomora opened locked doors...
Facts, dates, and incantations swirled through Hermione's mind.  She tried the Alohomora spell and got it right on her third attempt.  Her parents had clapped with happiness, telling her she would soon make a great witch.
However, they were confused on one thing, which made Hermione very nervous indeed.  Where in the world was Platform 9 and 3/4?
As far as the Granger family knew, there were only platforms 9 and 10.  Why would there be a 3/4 platform?  What were these wizards thinking of?  That led to more doubts...What if it was all a trick?  A very elaborate and pointless trick, but a trick nonetheless.  They couldn't know for sure.  They would have to wait for the Ministry of Magic representative to clear up the confusion.
There were so many interesting institutions and people in the wizarding world...One of the most interesting things Hermione had read about so far was the relationship between Harry Potter and the one they called He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, or You-Know-Who.  The textbooks only said the name Lord Voldemort once, then they retreated to calling him by those nicknames.  That seemed the acceptable wizarding thing to do, so Hermione called him that as well.
You-Know-Who was a really terrible dark wizard.  He was evil and killed so many people in the past few decades years.  But one day, he tried to kill a baby named Harry Potter.  The spell backfired, and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named disappeared.  The baby actually lived, when no one else had ever survived the same curse before!  It was such a great mystery.
Hermione was happy to know that Harry Potter was her age and had been brought up by muggles, just like her.  You-Know-Who killed his parents, and he was sent to live in a non-magical family.  That meant that even though he was so mysterious and well-known in the wizarding world, he was just as young and isolated as she from the magical world.  That gave Hermione the strength to learn as much magic as possible and to not let the fact that she was from a muggle family hurt her ambitions as a witch.
~~~~~~~~~~
September the first finally arrived.  Hermione woke up early and checked over her trunk, which she had packed the night before.  She double-checked its contents with her school list and all the things she would need to live at Hogwarts for the school year.
Her parents helped her drag the heavy trunk down the stairs and load it into the car.  Then, they waited.  It was just like the day they had waited for Professor McGonagall.
Jean cleared her throat and said nervously, "I really hope this representative can explain the platform number.  We're worried about you, Hermione."
This was the last time Hermione would see her parents until at least Christmas and the first time they would ever be separated.  Hermione had never even been to a sleepover or to visit a relative in a different part of the country by herself.  She would miss her parents dearly, but at the same time had a fiery desire to learn magic and be a part of the world in which she belonged.  She was a witch and needed to be with other witches and wizards in order to be happy.Shivering and nervous, the first year students followed the man along a narrow path.  It was so dark they could barely see anything around them.  Neville sniffed occasionally.  Hermione felt bad that they hadn't find his toad throughout the train ride.  Hopefully he would turn up soon.
"In a second, you'll have your firs' look at Hogwarts," the wild man exclaimed over his shoulder.  "Just around this curve."
There was a loud "Oooh!"
The narrow path opened suddenly to the edge of a great, black lake.  On the top of a tall mountain, on the other side, with its windows shining under the starry sky, was an impressive castle with many towers and turrets.
"No more 'an four to a boat!" shouted their leader, signaling to a flock of little boats sitting at the water’s edge.  Hermione and Neville followed Harry Potter and Ron Weasley into one of them.
"Everyone in?" continued the man, having one boat to himself.  "All righ', forward!"
The little group of boats began at the same time to float along the lake, which was as smooth as cristal.  Everyone waited silently, their eyes on the great castle above as they reached an overpass.
"Heads down!" shouted their leader as the first boats reached the pass.  Everyone lowered their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy, which hid a thin opening in the front part of the rocky outcrop.  They went through a dark tunnel which seemed to take them right under the castle, until they arrived at a kind of underground wharf where they floated over rocks and pebbles.
"Hey, you, over there!  This your toad?" asked the man as people began to get out of their boats.
"Trevor!" Neville yelled happily, extending his hands to greet Trevor.  He returned to Hermione's side holding the toad, looking happier and more relieved than she had seen him all day.
They ascended a rocky pathway following the light of the giant man's lamp and came out onto smooth grass in the shadow of the castle.  They went up some stone steps and stopped in front of a great oak door.
"Everyone here?  You there, still got your toad?"
Neville nodded as the man lifted a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle doors.  The doors opened immediately and Professor McGonagall stood there!  Hermione smiled and almost jumped in excitement, but caught herself just in time.  The Professor stared at all of the students as though deciding who would be the best one.  Her eyes caught Hermione's and a flicker of a smile passed her lips, though Hermione was sure she was the only one who noticed.
"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall," said the giant man.
"Thank you, Hagrid.  I'll take them from here."
So the large man's name was Hagrid.  He walked away, wild hair swinging from side to side with each tremendous footstep.  When Hermione stopped looking at him and turned to Professor McGonagall again, she saw that the door had opened wide and gave view to a spectacular Entrance Hall.  It was as big as a cathedral and lined of stone walls with torches.  The ceiling reached higher than Hermione could see, and a large, marble staircase in front of them led to the floors above.
Professor McGonagall led them into a small room leading off the side of the Entrance Hall, past a loud and rambunctious room to the right.  This room was cramped and hard to move around in, but that didn't stop Hermione from wanting to cry with happiness.  She was finally at Hogwarts, and it was perfectly magnificent.
"Welcomes to Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall.  "The Start-of-Term banquet will begin soon, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall you will need to be sorted into Houses.  The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be like your family at Hogwarts.  You'll have class with your House, sleep in the House dormitories, and spend free time in your House's common room.They entered the Gryffindor common room: a large, circular room filled with many comfortable-looking red armchairs, warm fireplaces, and wood tables.  It all looked so relaxing and warm Hermione couldn't help but yawn.  Percy pointed out the girls' dormitory, upstairs on the left side, and the boys' on the right.
Hermione, with the rest of the girls, headed up a spiral, stone staircase that was probably in one of the towers.  There was a door the read, "First Years," and Hermione was the first of her dorm mates to enter.
The circular room contained three beds with red curtains drawn around them.  A wide window stood opposite the entrance, thrown open to the grounds.  Hermione's trunk was at the corner of her bed, which was the farthest right.
Shivering, she went to shut the large window.  When she turned back around, Hermione saw the entrance of two giggling girls she recalled from the Sorting and the Gryffindor table.
One of them had dark skin and a beautiful, sleek black plait that fell to her waist.  The other was pale with curly brown hair and a small face.  They stopped when they saw Hermione.
"Hi," she said breathlessly.  "I'm Hermione Granger, pleasure to meet you."
The curly-haired one nearly fell forward in excitement and said, "Lavender Brown.  I can't believe this is our room, it's wonderful!"
"There's only three of us?" questioned the other girl.  "I'm Parvati, by the way.  Parvati Patil."
Hermione nodded at her and then all three girls went to unpack their trunks.  After extracting most things out of her trunk, only her books at the very bottom were left.  She piled them on top of her trunk since there seemed no other place to put them.
"Wow, you have so many books," Lavender said in a slightly rude way.  "Do you plan on having any fun this year?"
Parvati stifled a laugh while Hermione looked down at her hands.  "Yes, I..." She wasn't sure how to answer.  But it didn't matter, because Lavender began a conversation with Parvati and didn't wait for Hermione to respond
Hermione felt jealous that Parvati and Lavender had had the chance to become friends before she met them.  They just happened to sit next to each other in the Great Hall and had a chance to talk, while Hermione had been stuck next to the boys.  If she'd had a chance to talk to her roommates before, maybe it would be easier to befriend them now.
She laid down in her bed with Hogwarts, a History at her side.  She'd already read it three times, but she needed something to distract herself from the girlish giggles coming from the other side of the room.  
Why won't they let me join the conversation? Hermione wondered, unable to take in any of what the page said.
"Good night," she mumbled ten minutes later after placing the books in a pile, changing into her pajamas, and extinguishing the candle on her nightstand.
Neither Lavender nor Parvati responded, as they were too busy chatting with one another.
What a terrible start! Hermione thought, throwing herself under the covers.  She bit her cheeks to hold back the tears that wanted to escape.  Tomorrow she would really have to work on starting conversations with people.  She needed to connect to her magical peers or else, she would be lonely here just as she had been in the muggle world.
~~~~~~~~~~
The next morning, Hermione had difficulty getting through the seven floors and one hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts.  The stairs changed direction and the doors sometimes wouldn't open unless you asked nicely or tickled them in the right place.  Hermione felt frustrated just trying to get to breakfast.  On the way, however, she met Neville, who was equally lost.  They managed to make it to the Great Hall with their teamwork in time to eat breakfast before classes.<strong>Dedicated to KatherineArlene for the awesome banner she made on the side!</strong>

Ever since her frightening encounter with Mr. Filch and Mrs. Norris' tail, Hermione had been wary of going anywhere she shouldn't.  She diligently kept to her classes and studying.  She  had grown even more occupied lately by the fact that Neville constantly asked her for help in every subject except Herbology, for which he appeared to have a knack.
Hermione, on the other hand, seemed to have a knack for all of her classes.  Her favorites by far were Transfiguration, Charms, and History of Magic.  The wizarding history class, taught by the school's only ghost instructor, Professor Binns, was extremely interesting to Hermione.  What better way to blend into the wizarding world than to know all about it and its history?  Transfiguration and Charms, however, happened to be the classes where the teachers appreciated her the most, and the subjects were her favorites.  She seemed to grasp material far faster than any other student in every class.
The Friday morning of her first week at Hogwarts, Hermione sat with Neville at breakfast.  She knew she had Potions that day, as she'd already memorized the schedule.  It was double Potions with the Slytherins, the House into which Draco Malfoy was sorted.  She didn't know why, but she felt nervous at the idea of having class with him.
A moment later, the flock of owls entered and Neville's daily package of items he had forgotten to bring from home landed in front of him.  He sighed with relief when he saw A Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, his Potions book, at the top of the package.  Then he pulled out the letter his grandmother had written him and read it in a whisper.
Looking up at Hermione, who was reaching for the milk jug, he said, "Gran says she still can't believe those dolts at the ministry haven't caught the people who broke into Gringotts..."
"Someone broke into Gringotts?" Hermione asked, startled.  It was hard to imagine something bad like that happening in this world.  Why would people need to steal anything if they had magic?
"Yeah," Neville responded.  "At the end of July.  That's why it's so unbelievable, no one can understand why they haven't been caught, or how they even broke in.  Some people are scared to put their money in there now."
The Potions classroom took place in the dungeons.  It was much colder down there in than in the Great Hall, and Hermione found herself hugging her robe around her.  The classroom itself was in one of the larger dungeons and felt cold and rather scary.  There were many different kinds of animals conserved in the room, floating in little glass jars.  It was dark and cold, but Hermione couldn't let that ruin her concentration in class.
The teacher was the same sallow-skinned, hook-nosed man from the start-of-term banquet.  He announced his name as Professor Snape, and began to call roll.  When he got to Harry Potter's name, he said with a deeply ridiculing sneer, "Ah, yes...Harry Potter.  Our new...celebrity."
Hermione watched as Harry's face grew slightly red.  He was seated only a few seats away from her with Ron Weasley, the redheaded boy who had made up that lousy spell to use on his rat.  She noticed Draco Malfoy, a few tables down, laughing with two of his friends at how Professor Snape had treated Harry.  It seemed like they had something against Harry, too, and not just her.  Or perhaps the Slytherins didn't like any Gryffindors; she'd heard from Neville about the ancient rivalry between the two Houses. 
Professor Snape seemed like a very serious professor for whom Hermione would have to work extra hard to please.  His black eyes were closed to the world and his black hair curtained around his face, as though he was not an easy person to get to know.Hermione decided she'd gotten angry too quickly, and that she needed to try harder to make friends.  A few weeks into the term, she walked into the common room to where Lavender and Parvati were sitting.
Upon reaching them, she said cheerfully, "Good morning!  The weather's getting awfully cold, isn't it?  I hope it doesn't ruin Halloween."  In her own ears, she sounded like a ridiculous, blundering child, but Lavender and Parvati only seemed mildly surprised.
"Yes, that wouldn't be good," responded Parvati with a shocked look on her face, as though surprised Hermione could speak outside of answering a teacher's question.  "I wonder what everyone is excited about over there?" She nodded towards the bulletin board, where most of the first years were huddled about, pointing at a notice.
"Oh, it's about our first flying lesson!  This Thursday, with the Slytherins," Hermione said, wrinkling her nose at the thought, unable to put on a happy face when thinking about the Slytherins.
Lavender laughed at her dislike of the Slytherins and then engaged Parvati in conversation.  Hermione was proud of herself and stayed with her dorm mates for a while, glowing red at the fact that she'd just made conversation with them.  Occasionally they asked her something or informed her of gossip or a club event in the castle.  Most of the time they talked amongst themselves, but Hermione went to bed that night feeling her chances at making friends were much better than before.
All the first year students who grew up in the wizarding world, from Draco Malfoy, to Seamus Finnegan,  and Neville Longbottom, talked of their experiences with flying.  Neville, of course, related how his grandmother never let him near a racing broom; his clumsiness would either merit a broken broomstick or a muggle spotting him.  Keeping wizards a secret from muggles was a serious business, and muggles seeing wizards flying was far too common of an occurrence.
Hermione spent most of the week leading up to the flying lesson reading Quidditch Through the Ages, a fascinating book about the popular wizarding sport and flying in general.  During breakfast the morning before their class, she was helping the other first years by telling them tips and facts she'd learned from the book.
Her speech was ended by the arrival of the owls.  One dropped a little package in front of Neville.  Commenting bluntly that it was from his grandmother, he opened it quickly and took out a glass ball, about the size of a walnut and full of what seemed like white smoke.
"It's a Remembrall!" he announced excitedly to the table.  "Gran knows I forget things, and this lets you know when you've forgotten to do something.  Look, you hold it tight, like this, and if it turns red..."  He paused as the Remembrall suddenly turned scarlet.  "Er, It means you've forgotten something..."
As Neville tried to remember what he'd forgotten to do, Hermione fired suggestions at him while reading One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.  Suddenly, a pale hand shot between their shoulders and grabbed the Remembrall from Neville's relaxed fingers.
Flicking her head around quickly, Hermione saw Draco Malfoy staring at the ball with a satisfied smirk on his ugly, pointed face.  Crabbe and Goyle flanked him.
She was about to open her mouth to tell him to give it back, but in that instant, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley jumped to their feet and demanded the very same.  Before Malfoy could respond, however, Professor McGonagall reached their spot at the Gryffindor table and asked, "What's going on here?"
"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor," Neville said quietly.
"I was only looking," Malfoy muttered, dropping the Remembrall on the table.
Hermione shook her head in disbelief and turned back to her book, somewhat in awe that Harry and Ron felt just as much injustice as she had.  Maybe they did have some sense in them.Chapter Ten - Halloween
Hermione had refused to speak to Harry or Ron after that horrific incident with the three-headed dog.  She hoped they would learn their lesson and admit she was right that Malfoy had tricked them and that they should stop breaking rules for no good reason.  With Neville, however, she did speak.  He was more nervous than usual lately and jumped whenever someone came up behind him unexpectedly.  
On the other hand, Hermione was more focused than ever and was constantly getting books from the library to try and figure out what might be precious enough to hide under the trapdoor.  So far, she'd made a list of possible, rare items the school might have procured and decided to protect, but she was no closer to figuring out which one it was than Ron was to developing decent dining habits.
At breakfast, Hermione was distracted from her thoughts about the guard dog by seeing how Ron had dribbled ketchup down his front and was talking with his mouth open, potatoes flying onto his incredibly full plate.  She shook her head in disgust and turned away as soon as the morning flock of owls flew into the Great Hall.
At once, everyone began pointing to a large, thin package carried by six white owls.  She and Neville pointed excitedly at it as it landed in front of Harry, who stared back at it in complete bewilderment.  He picked up a card left by another owl, read it, and whispered something to Ron.  Huge grins appeared on both their faces and they left the table quickly, Ron leaving behind a plate full of food with a regretful look on his face.
After finishing her own breakfast, Hermione realized she forgot to bring a quill for class.  She hurried into the Entrance Hall but suddenly heard the sneering voice of Malfoy.  She stopped in her tracks and hid behind the door to listen.
"Potter's been sent a broom, Professor," he said quickly.
"Yes, yes, very good," said the voice of their Charms professor, Professor Flitwick, "Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter.  What model is it?"
Hermione's mouth dropped at these words.  The professors were sincerely praising Harry for his rule-breaking!  Had the world turned upside-down?
"A Nimbus 2000, sir.  And it's really thanks to Malfoy here that I got it."
A second later, Malfoy rushed into the Great Hall, so furiously he nearly knocked Hermione over but didn't notice.  She stopped her charade of hiding in time to see Professor Flitwick also enter the hall.
Remembering she needed a quill but with her mind clouded by the injustice Hogwarts was currently exhibiting, Hermione dashed towards the marble staircase.  At the top were Harry and Ron, who were still chattering excitedly about their broomstick.
Hermione rushed up behind them and said loudly, "So  you think that's a reward for breaking the rules?"
"I thought you weren't speaking to us," Harry said coldly after turning to face her.
"Yes, don't stop now," said Ron, the pig.  "It's doing us so much good."
Hermione stomped away and ahead of them, unable to believe how much they'd gotten away with and that they still weren't thanking her for wanting to help them all the time.  They were so insufferably selfish!
~~~~~~~~~~
Halloween had arrived, but Hermione was nervous.  It would mean being in the Great Hall like she was every day, but it would be for a longer amount of time and everyone would be happy socializing and enjoying the festivities.  She had no one with whom to celebrate.  Neville usually kept quiet through meals, so she couldn't count on him for conversation.  There were times she even considered taking some bread from the table and going to the restrooms to hide for the rest of the night, so no one could see that she didn't have friends.Being friends with Harry and Ron, though a new and sometimes confusing experience for Hermione, was rewarding in the happiness she now had every day.
She learned that no matter how famous Harry was, that didn't mean he had to be the best student or the most respected wizard.  He had a right to be however he wanted, even if that meant mediocre student and occasional rule breaker.  He was, however, a very talented Quidditch player and a very considerate friend, never being too harsh on Hermione nor too outspoken.
Ron, on the other hand, was like a firework let loose.  He said whatever was on his mind, called Hermione a know-it-all frequently as though he had good intentions by saying it, and appeared to have no talent whatsoever in anything.  Hermione found herself correcting his and Harry's homework every night.
It did get frustrating sometimes, but it made Hermione feel wanted, needed, and appreciated.  The benefits of her new friendships swelled her heart with comfort and a glee she'd never felt before.
One night, as Hermione was crossing out the mistakes on Ron's Charms essay, Harry entered the common room looking bothered and hurried over to them.  When they asked what was wrong, he quickly explained how he'd gone to ask for a book back that Professor Snape had confiscated and he'd entered the teachers' lounge to see Professor Snape with a bloody leg, being bandaged by Argus Filch, the caretaker.
"You know what that means?" Harry exclaimed, out of breath.  "He must have tried to get past that three-headed dog, on Halloween!  That's where he was headed when we saw him...he was trying to get what's hidden!  And I'd bet my broomstick he let the troll in, too, as a distraction!"
Hermione stared at him incredulously, thinking how idiotic it was to come to such a conclusion so rapidly.  He pushed his black, wire-rimmed glasses up his nose and waited for their reactions.
"No, that can't be true," Hermione said thoughtfully.  "I know he's not very good, but he wouldn't try to steal something Dumbledore was guarding."
"Really, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something," Ron said angrily.  "I'm with Harry.  I'd suspect Snape of anything.  But what's he looking for?  What's that dog guarding?"
How could they jump to such a conclusion just because they don't like a teacher?  Plenty of people get their legs hurt, it doesn't mean they were bitten by a monstrous three-headed dog while trying to steal a precious object from their own place of employment! Hermione thought angrily.  
She watched in silence as Harry and Ron pondered Snape's culpability.  Though she couldn't agree on Snape, she was equally curious about what the dog was guarding...They'd gotten no closer to figuring it out, but every day the mystery became more intriguing.
~~~~~~~~~~
The next morning was the first Quidditch match of the year, and Hermione couldn't wait to see it.  Even though flying was the one thing she seemed to not be very good at in Hogwarts, she'd read Quidditch through the Ages and found the sport's history and popularity very intriguing.
The previous night, she, Ron, Dean Thomas, and Seamus Finnegan took an old sheet that Scabbers, Ron's rat, had ruined by biting through it.  They'd written, "Potter for President," across it, and Dean drew a Gryffindor lion.  Next, Hermione used a charm that made the letters flash different colors.
They were now seated in one of the highest stands, holding the banner up high so Harry could see it when he came out onto the field.
Quidditch was a game with seven players on each team who tried to score with a big, red ball through three, fifty-foot-high hoops on either end of the field.  While the Chasers tried to score, Beaters would try to hit flying, black Bludgers towards opposing teammates.Winter settled upon Hogwarts like a soft blanket over a sleeping child, muffling out fears and inducing calm and happiness.  Everywhere Hermione went, the castle was decorated with Christmas trees, tinsel, baubles, mistletoe...Everything needed for the Christmas spirit.
Though in the library, under librarian Madam Pince's scrutinizing glare which assumed every student was defiling a book or breaking rules, sat Hermione, Harry, and Ron, pouring over textbook after textbook in search of information about Nicolas Flamel.
Ever since Hagrid had mentioned the wizard's name, the three of them had spent every break and most of their lunches at the library, searching through possible books which might list his name.  They truly had no idea whether he was famous enough to get himself mentioned in a book, but since Professor Dumbledore knew him personally there was a possibility, and Hermione was certain she'd heard the name somewhere before, so they'd decided to search the library books.
Much to Hagrid's displeasure, for he still refused to tell them anything about the mysterious Flamel, Hermione and her friends perused books like Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, and Important Magical Discoveries of the Modern Age.  The information on Nicolas Flamel eluded Hermione so perfectly despite her innumerable attempts to scour her brain for information on the man.   
She sighed and left the library to meet Harry and Ron outside, where they all announced somberly that they'd discovered nothing of the wizard.  They walked to lunch, each of their heads filled with facts and biographies they'd just read and anger that none of them contained even a hint of information on Nicolas Flamel.
"You're going to keep looking while I'm gone, won't you?" asked Hermione.  "If you find anything, send me an owl."
"And you can ask your parents if they know who he is," suggested Ron.  "It would be safe to ask them."
"Very safe, as they're both dentists," Hermione agreed.
She was indeed heading home for Christmas, back to her parents.  They'd written each other nearly every week and she missed them terribly, despite the fun she was now enjoying at Hogwarts.  She couldn't wait to tell them all she'd learned!
At first, she was surprised to know that some people actually wanted to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas.  Who wouldn't want to see their families after such a long separation?  But then...there were people like Harry, who had terrible guardians and treasured every second away from them.  Ron and his siblings, on the other hand, were staying at Hogwarts because their parents were going to visit their older brother Charlie in Romania, where he studied dragons.  
She meant it when she meant they ought to look for Flamel while on break.  If she came back and found out they didn't do any work, she would vow to not check their homework or help them study for at least a week.  That would show them to not slack off!
That evening, Hermione quickly checked over her trunk and section of the dormitory to make sure she hadn't forgotten anything.  Parvati and Lavender had just finished packing and were now sitting on their beds chatting.
"Are you excited to go home for the holidays, Hermione?" Lavender suddenly asked.
Ever since Harry and Ron had become Hermione's friends, Lavender, Parvati, and everyone else, in fact, seemed to be friendlier towards her.  
"Very much," Hermione replied.  "And you?"
She nodded vigorously and Parvati said, "Be sure to tell us all about it when you get back!"
Hermione smiled back and thought that even though Parvati and Lavender were now being decent to her, Harry and Ron were destined to be her true friends and nothing would ever change that.  They were in Hogwarts together, and they would stick it through to the end.After a long train ride during which Hermione took a nice nap, she exited at Hogsmeade station with most of Hogwarts' students, and proceeded to a carriage with Neville, who chatted endlessly about his Christmas presents, which included a watch, a new hat, and some treats for Trevor the toad.
Meanwhile, Hermione couldn't hold back her excitement.  She knew Harry and Ron must have found something about Nicolas Flamel!  They'd been in Hogwarts for the entire break and had many more opportunities to visit the library than she had had.
"Hermione!" greeted Ron enthusiastically as she embraced both of them upon entering the portrait hole of Gryffindor tower.
They chatted about their holidays and Christmas gifts, but Hermione felt Harry was holding something back.  After a long minute of silence, she finally whispered, "So, have you found anything out about...Flamel?  Or about you-know-what?"  She thought it funny to say that, since they really had no idea what the object being guarded was.
"Er..." began Harry, looking anywhere but at her.  Finally he said, "Truthfully, we haven't really been looking.  We got distracted..."
"Distracted?" she asked incredulously.  "What could possibly be more important over holidays?"
"Well, we found this mirror.  Or I did, actually.  I inherited an Invisibility Cloak from my father-"
"Really?  Those are incredibly rare, Harry!" Hermione exclaimed.
He nodded, then continued uneasily, "Well, I used it to search in the library one night, but I ended up finding a mirror inside an empty classroom."
And he continued to tell her how he found a dangerous mirror that showed him his heart's greatest desire, to be with his family.  While the mirror seemed bad enough, he'd gone out three nights in a row to stare at it pointlessly!
"What?" Hermione gasped.  "How could you waste all your time in front of a mirror?  And Ron, why didn't you stop him?" Ron looked up shocked, as though he didn't feel any fault in the matter.  "If Filch had caught you, you could have been given a detention, or been expelled!  Then we would never find out who Flamel is or what Fluffy's guarding, all because of a mirror!"
"I know, I know," Harry said in exasperated tones.  "I'm sorry.  We'll try harder to find it now."
"It's not like we could have done, without your brains," Ron said, making Hermione blush unwillingly.
So they continued to search, late into the night and during all their breaks, but growing disheartened as the days went by.
Then one night, Harry returned from Quidditch practice covered in mud, as Hermione was in the process of losing a game of wizard chess to Ron.  She didn't care much for the violent game, but Harry and Ron insisted she play it "For her own good," whatever that meant.
"Don't talk to me for a minute," Ron said, fixated on the game.  "I need to concen - What's the matter?  You look terrible."
Hermione looked up and indeed saw that Harry's face looked pale and stricken.  In a low voice, he explained to them that his Quidditch captain, Oliver Wood, had just informed him that Professor Snape wanted to be the referee for Gryffindor's upcoming match.
"Don't play," Hermione said instantly, remembering with a shudder of fear how close to death Harry had come when faced with Snape in the previous match.
"Say you're ill," said Ron.
"Pretend to break your leg."
"Really break your leg," Ron added.
"I can't," Harry said in a defeated tone of voice.  "There's not another Seeker.  If I don't play, Gryffindor forfeits."
Hermione thought there shouldn't be much indecision between death and losing a Quidditch game, but apparently with boys, there was.  However, she couldn't ponder it very long because another disaster had just entered the portrait hole."Hermione, exams are ages away," moaned Ron for the millionth time as Hermione finished making his study guide.
"Ten weeks, that's not ages.  That's like a second to Nicolas Flamel,” she snapped.
While in the library one afternoon studying for Potions, Harry exclaimed, "Hagrid!  What are you doing in the library?"
Hagrid appeared, barely fitting in the confined spaces of the library.  "Just looking.  And what are you doing?" His voice suddenly became suspicious.  "You're not still looking for Nicolas Flamel, are ya'?"
"Oh, we found him ages ago," said Ron triumphantly.  "And we know what the dog's guarding, it's the Sorcerer's-"
Hagrid shushed him, thankfully.  Ron really should have known better not to talk about what the three-headed dog was guarding.  While Hagrid told off Ron, Hermione noticed he was trying very hard to keep his hands behind his back.  It seemed as though he were hiding something.
Then Harry asked what was guarding the stone other than Fluffy, to which Hagrid responded, "Shh!  Look, come see me later.  I'm not promisin' I'll say anythin', but don't go around talkin' about it, students aren't supposed to know.  They'll think I've told you something..."
"We'll see you later, then," said Harry.
"What was he hiding behind his back?" Hermione asked as soon as Hagrid had left the library.
Minutes later, Ron had searched the section Hagrid was looking in and brought back books as proof.  "Dragons, Hagrid was looking up things about dragons!  Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland, and From Egg to Inferno, Guide for Guardians of Dragons."
"Hagrid's always wanted to have a dragon, he told me the first time he met me." Harry closed the book he’d been reading and looked at Hermione and Ron meaningfully.
Hermione's hand slapped to her mouth.  What foolish thing could Hagrid possibly be planning?
"But it's against our laws," Ron stated the obvious.  "Raising dragons was prohibited by the Wizard's Convention in 1709, everyone knows that.  It was difficult for the muggles not to notice us if we had dragons in our backyards.  Anyway, it's impossible to domesticate a dragon; it's dangerous.  You should see the burns Charlie's got from wild ones in Romania."
"But there's no wild dragons in England, right?" asked Harry.
"Of course there are," said Ron, surprising Hermione with his intelligence.  Albeit, he had grown up as a wizard.  "Common Welsh Greens, and Hebridean Blacks in Scotland.  The ministry's got a tough job of keeping them quiet, I can tell you.  We have to put all sorts of charms on muggles who've see them so they forget."
"Then what's Hagrid getting into?" Hermione asked.
Later that night, after Hermione studied Charms for a bit, they headed to Hagrid's cabin to ask him which professors had worked to guard the stone.  He informed them that Snape was indeed one of the professors and, as usual, Harry and Ron jumped to conclusions.  
Hermione, on the other hand, wasn't about to delete Snape as a suspect who would steal the stone, but she also wouldn't accuse Snape and only Snape, without even looking at the other options.  
"Hagrid, can we open a window?" Harry asked, pulling his shirt away from his sweaty skin.  "I'm boiling."
Hagrid hesitated, looking at the the cauldron sitting in his fire.  Earlier, when the three of them had passed by, Hermione had instantly recognized it as a dragon's egg.  
He then admitted to the truth.  "I won it the other night.  I was in the village, drinking and I started playing cards with some strange.  I think he was happy to get rid of it, to tell the truth."Oh no.  Oh no, oh no, oh no, played over and over again in Hermione's head.
They were doomed.  Professor McGonagall had them in her office and was giving them the scolding of a lifetime for having snuck out at night and now, she had brought Neville Longbottom in, too.
"Harry!" exclaimed Neville.  "I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you.  He said you had a drag-"
Harry shook his head like an idiot to quiet Neville, immediately giving them away to Professor McGonagall.
"I never would have believed it of any of you," she said viciously, her lips a thin, shaking line.  "Mr. Filch said you were in the Astronomy Tower.  It's one 'o'clock in the morning.  Explain yourselves."
Hermione couldn't speak.  She was going to be expelled, sent back to the Muggle world, and tortured again for being different.  And it was all because of Hagrid's dragon.  But she had only met Hagrid because of Harry and Ron, who were great friends at first, but now seemed to be getting her into far too much trouble...
"I think I know what happened here," said the professor, continuing Hermione's nightmare.  "It doesn't take a genius to figure it out.  You invented some hogwash tale about a dragon so Draco Malfoy would go out of bed and get in trouble.  I already caught him.  You thought it would be funny if Longbottom overheard the story and believed it, too?  I'm disgusted.  Four students out of bed in one night.  I've never heard of such a thing!  You, Hermione Granger, I thought you had more sense."  Her words stung like a bee, but one that made Hermione bleed from the inside with guilt, sorrow, and fear.  "And you, Harry Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you.  All three of you will receive detentions...Yes, you too, Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to wander around at night, especially in these days, it's very dangerous.  And I will take fifty points from Gryffindor.
"Fifty?" said Harry, shocked.
"Fifty points each," finished the professor in a threatening voice.
She then sent them to bed, but Hermione didn't even care about the points.  She had scraped by without an expulsion, but she brought shame to Gryffindor House by having lost the points and by receiving a detention.  She was supposed to be a perfect student.  She had failed as a witch.
In the days that followed, Hermione had become infinitely more quiet and reserved, especially during class, no longer raising her hand to answer teachers' questions.  She knew all of Gryffindor was angry at her, Harry, and Neville for having lost all of those house points and thereby being placed last in the running for the House Cup.  
She tried to make Harry feel better - since he was a celebrity in the school, many more people taunted him than they did her - but nothing she said cheered him up, and she was very angry with him.
If it wasn't for Harry and Ron's foolishness, they wouldn't be in this situation.  Since they hadn't been expelled, Hermione was slightly nicer to them.  But honestly, she didn't want their friendship to continue.  
She couldn't possibly go back to the Muggle world anymore. Hagrid was a great and nice man, but her future was more important than his mad desire to keep a monster in his cabin.
On top of all that, Harry had walked by a classroom where he heard Professor Quirrell sound as though he was being tortured.  Professor Snape must have finally gotten out of him the rest of the secrets to getting past the enchantments that protected the stone...except Fluffy.
That was all very dangerous, but Hermione was not interested in pursuing the case any further.  She had gotten into enough trouble to last her a lifetime, thank you very much.The exams came up, and Hermione's mind was distracted nearly entirely from any thought of stopping Professor Snape from stealing the stone.  She needed to concentrate on studying and nothing else.
And it turned out well for her; all of her written and practical exams went amazingly well, as she told Harry and Ron after their last exam, History of Magic.
"That was much easier than I thought.  I needn't have studied the Werewolf Code of Conduct of 1637."
As Ron fretted about the exams saying he had probably failed - with which Hermione was not about to disagree - Harry rubbed his forehead furiously, saying, "I wish I knew what this meant!  My scar keeps hurting.  It's happened before, but never as much as now."
"Go see Madam Pomfrey," suggested Hermione.
"I'm not sick," said Harry.  "I think it's a warning...it means danger's coming."
"Relax, Harry," said Ron, cleary under the balmy influence of the summer sun.  "Hermione's right, the stone is safe as long as Dumbledore is here.  Anyway, we don't have any proof Snape found a way to get past Fluffy.  It bit his leg once, he's not going to try any time soon.  And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid betrays Dumbledore."
Harry said that he had the feeling he'd forgotten something important, but he couldn't remember what it was.
"That's the exams," Hermione said, remembering the same feeling from the past weeks.  "I woke up last night and was about to study Transfiguration, before I remembered we'd already done that one."
Harry didn't respond, but sat staring out at the grass.  A minute later, he jumped up.
"Where are you going?" asked Ron lazily.
"I just thought of something," Harry said.  "We have to go see Hagrid."
It must have been something dreadfully important to have put Harry in this mood.  "Why?" Hermione asked, standing up as well, ready for action now that the finals had passed.
"Don't you think it's a little strange," Harry began as they walked quickly along the grass towards Hagrid's cabin.  "That the thing Hagrid wants most of all is a dragon, and a stranger comes along who just happens to have one?  How many people walk around with dragons in their pockets, if they're prohibited by magical law?  Lucky he found Hagrid, don't you think?  Why didn't I think of it before?"
Hermione thought about what Harry said, but it frustrated her that she was unable to follow his line of thought.  
So they reached Hagrid's hut, and Harry asked Hagrid a few questions as he shelled peas over a large bin.  As Hagrid explained that the stranger he'd met in the pub with the dragon had a hood over his face the entire time they spoke, and was asking questions about the animals Hagrid took care of, imparticular Fluffy, Hermione began to catch on.
"So, then I told him Fluffy's great if you know how to calm him; just play a bit o' music, he'll fall right to sleep."
And Hermione's fears were confirmed.  The man under the cape in the Hog's Head Inn must have been seeking that precious information for Snape or Voldemort.  Or perhaps it was even Snape or Voldemort under the cape!
They ran back to the castle in a frenzy, searched for Dumbledore's office, but had no idea where to look, as none of them had ever been there before.
"We'll have to-" began Harry.
"What are you three doing inside?" came Professor McGonagall's voice, who walked towards them in the entrance hall carrying many books.
"We want to see Professor Dumbledore," said Hermione.Hermione sat up quickly as Ron began to awake, acting as though she had done nothing to stir him.  Thankfully, he didn't ask her any questions about his awakening, because he was too distracted with asking questions about Harry.
"Let's run, and I'll tell you on the way!" Hermione said, pulling him to his feet.  They ran back to the room with the keys, Hermione telling him how they had to get past the riddle and that only Harry could go on.  By the time they had mounted their broomsticks and zoomed past the Devil's Snare and up to the trapdoor, she had finished telling Ron about the current plan; to send a letter to Professor Dumbledore, all the while hoping beyond hope that Harry would be all right.  His chances did not seem very good.
They reached the Owlery within a few minutes, but before they could even call down Hedwig, a large black shape came towards them from outside, getting closer and closer until it was right on top of them and through the large, open window.
It was Professor Dumbledore! Hermione cheered inside of her own head.  He was here, he was here!
"Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?" the professor asked, dismounting from a broomstick at once and looking into the terrified faces of Hermione and Ron.  How  did he know?
"Yes!" Hermione told him, and before she could do another thing, the professor was off, down the stairs from the Owlery and out of sight.
~~~~~~~~~~
The next days passed by Hermione in a blur.  Everything was confused, because no one knew what the real story of what had happened down under the trapdoor.  Professor Dumbledore had rescued Harry somehow, but she and Ron were as close to finding out what he had been rescued from as they were to hearing what truly happened down there.  And the thing that confused them most of all: Professor Snape was walking around the castle freely.
Many people took time out of their day to question Hermione and Ron about what happened, but they honestly did not know.  Neville, on the other hand, realized that it was important and did not bother asking many questions, only taking enough time to say he was sorry for suspecting them.  Hermione then took an equal amount of time to apologize for having petrified Neville.
Harry was currently resting in the hospital wing, unconscious.  Hermione and Ron had so far been forbidden to see him, but today Madam Pomfrey told them he was awake when they went to ask her once more whether they could go in or not.  
Instead of responding directly to them, she went to talk to Harry first.  She came back a few minutes later with a sour expression, telling them, "Five minutes only."
Hermione ran in the hospital wing and wanted to throw her arms around him, but then she remembered the last time she got close to one of her friends; when she had kissed Ron below the trapdoor.  She must learn to contain herself.  Also, Harry looked so fragile lying helplessly in the bed and wrapped in bandages that she did not want to risk hurting him.
And so he told them what had happened.  Apparently, it was Professor Quirrell who was trying to steal the Stone, not Snape.  Professor Snape had been trying to stop Professor Quirrell, and had also tried to stop Quirrell from killing Harry at the Quidditch match, for Quirrell had been chanting the incantation.  
The Mirror of Erised had been below also, with Quirrell, and Harry had been able to look into the mirror and receive the Stone!  Then, You-Know-Who started talking to Harry and trying to convince him to hand over the Stone, and Professor Quirrell even attacked Harry!  However, something about Quirrell's connection to You-Know-Who made him vulnerable to even being touched by Harry.  
Professor Quirrell was dead by the time Professor Dumbledore had come to rescue Harry, who Professor Dumbledore feared had died.  Nicolas Flamel would have to destroy the Stone and die, so that no one else could use it.  Since I'm not going to write the entire series from Hermione's perspective, I have another idea that hopefully my readers will like just as much.
I'll be taking requests for one-shots. You resquest any scene/chapter from any book, pre- or post- Hogwarts, any character's perspective, canon or non-canon. I'll write whatever you want and dedicate it to you.
The fanfictions I've written after this are:
1. Hermione Granger: The Battle's Not Yet Won. It's a post-Hogwarts story where Hermione attempts to find her parents and balance her personal life.
2. Brother of Ruin: Diary of Brothers Severus and Wilfred Snape. It's a non-canon story following the life of Wilfred Snape, Severus' long-lost brother, through his memories and shown compared to Snape's own diary entries. It explains a lot of Severus' and Bellatrix's lives as well as some other characters, like Dean Thomas (and his family) and Severus' parents.
Depending on how busy I am, each one-shot will take a different amount of time for me to post. But I will write and post every single one as well as give you a heads-up of how long it will take me to do so :). I'd prefer you to request either in the comments here or via a private message. 
Enjoy!Two cauldron-fulls of frustration seemed to build up all around Quidditch.  Hermione had never had much love for the sport, and since it was all Harry and Ron could talk about, any mention of it set her brain on fire.
With worrying about the return of Voldemort and an ever-increasing amount of homework in her advanced classes, Quidditch was welcome to take a backseat in her life.  But with tryouts approaching fast, Harry and Ron could find nothing else to talk about.  Just that morning at breakfast, Harry - the captain and Seeker for Gryffindor's team -  was complaining about how many people had signed up for the tryouts.
"Oh, come on, Harry," Hermione said impatiently, shutting her Arithmancy book.  She always had to make them see sense, and trying to reason Quidditch just seemed pointless to her.  "It's not Quidditch that's popular, it's you!  You've never been more interesting, and frankly, you've never been more fanciable."
Ron started to gag on his kipper, clearly shocked at the idea that Hermione understood the notion of fancying someone.  Only in their fourth year did he come to the conclusion that she was indeed a girl.  He was so blind to his own emotions she was surprised he could play so well as Keeper on Gryffindor's team.  
But even in that case, he couldn't see how good he was and let his nerves get in the way of performance.  Hermione kept telling him he'd do fine, but of course, he never listened.  She sent him a look of disdain before returning to Harry.
"Everyone knows you've been telling the truth now, don't they?  The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and that you really fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times. And now they're calling you 'the Chosen One' -- well, come on, can't you see why people are fascinated by you?  And you've been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar. You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood, but you stuck to your story anyway. . . ."
"You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry, look," said Ron, revealing his arms in reference to the previous term when they'd barely escaped Death Eaters with their lives and lost Sirius Black, Harry's godfather, in the struggle.  It was the same day the Ministry finally came to face the fact that Voldemort had returned.  How Ron could try to outperform Harry in terms of who had the worst deal last year was beyond Hermione.  So she ignored him.
"And it doesn't hurt that you've grown about a foot over the summer either," she added to Harry.
"I'm tall," said Ron, looking incredibly grumpy.
Hermione shot him one more incredulous look before sighing and disappearing behind her books.
In no time at all, however, they were heading down to the Quidditch Pitch, Ron looking green and queasy all the way.  Nothing Hermione said could cheer him up.  On their way out, they passed Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, who turned around and smiled at Ron.
One simple smile from Lavender brought on a whole word of change in Ron that Hermione's endless reasoned arguments simply could not do.  His face lit up, and he strutted down to the pitch.  
Hermione took her seat in the stands, fuming, but not quite sure what made her so angry.  Sure, she should be a little frustrated and disappointed at Ron's utter ignorance of her, but it filled her with such a boiling hatred she couldn't understand what was bothering her.
She watched the tryouts go by, one disappointment following the other as the majority of the tryouts simply wanted to see Harry.  There was a group of giggling girls, a pack of first years who hadn't even brought their broomsticks...the whole nine yards.Hermione knew she'd promised Professor McGonagall and even written the Ministry of Magic a special letter saying she'd only use the Time Turner for academic pursuits.  But its advantages were so many, and if she were careful enough...
She thought herself slightly pathetic.  How many times have I gone back to this very moment?  I've lost track....she thought to herself, hidden in a corner of the Gryffindor common room with a protective Disillusionment Charm in place so no one would see her.  
She pursed her lips at the event she'd gone back in time to watch for the thousandth time - the night their friendship ended.  Ron had run up to his dormitory and found bloody sheets, with his pet rat, Scabbers, gone missing.  Thus ensued the row of all rows, and Hermione watched herself shaking under Ron's yells of, "BLOOD!  HE'S MISSING!  AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?"
While she couldn't be sure of the truth, Hermione wished for forgiveness.  She'd tried to defend herself when really she should have apologized for the slight possibility that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers.  
However, she was a person of reason, and there simply was not enough evidence against her, so she pleaded not guilty.  But Ron wouldn't let it go.  And of course, Harry sided with him.
"Crookshanks must have eaten him.  All the evidence points that way," he'd insisted.
"I knew you'd side with Ron!" Hermione had exclaimed, feeling tears in her eyes.  "First the Firebolt, now Scabbers, it's all my fault, isn't it?  Just leave me alone, Harry.  I have a lot of work to do."
But instead of studying diligently like she should have been doing, she concentrated on two things these days - going back in time to watch that fight over and over again to dissect her mistakes, and look up a case for Buckbeak, Hagrid's hippogriff, who faced an unjust trial.  Even having one of these responsibilities lifted from her shoulders would mean a great deal to Hermione, since her school schedule was taxing enough.  
So technically, using the Time Turner was academic - she was trying to rectify her mistakes by going back in time so she wouldn't have to worry about them anymore and would be able to study more.  No luck so far.
She sighed and flipped the Time Turner around a bit more.  Simply flipping it sent her back hours, but twisting the chain and then flipping sent her back by days.
Then Hermione was in Hogsmeade on the first trip there of her life.  Harry, without a signed note from the Dursleys, couldn't attend.  However, she and Ron promised to bring him back loads of sweets from Honeydukes.
She followed, still under the Disillusionment Charm, as she and Ron perused the joke shops, owl post office, and other stores in the village until Ron suggested a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks.
"What's a Butterbeer taste like?" Hermione asked curiously.
"Oh, you'll love it!  It's like you're drinking candy, basically..." and Ron went off, as he usually did, describing in depth anything that tasted sweet to him.  His lengthy descriptions of food usually made her grimace, but Hermione, watching from a distance and camouflaged, felt the corners of her lips curl up in a smile.
And Butterbeer was indeed delicious.  In fact, she found herself wishing she could get a glass of it as she watched her past self and Ron drink the stuff.  Just then the bartender, Madam Rosmerta, walked up to their table to set down the drinks.
"Anything else for you two?"  When past Hermione and Ron shook their heads, she said, "That'll be ten sickles."  They each pulled out their change, Ron blushing as bright red as his hair as he did so.  Madam Rosmerta was blonde, curvy, and very attractive.It happened one day in the library while Harry and Ron had Divination.  Hermione had felt him watching her for at least ten minutes, and she'd read the same sentence over and over again, unable to concentrate on her Ancient Runes essay.
She'd been in the library for about an hour now, seated at her usual table.  He always entered just a few minutes after her; she could hardly remember a time she was in the library and he wasn't.  She thought he was simply diligently studying for the next task, but now, she felt him watching her.  There was a greater purpose to his library visits.
His fan club has dispersed after twenty minutes or so of trying and failing to pluck up the courage to ask him for an autograph.  Thank goodness, Hermione thought, They're so distracting.
Then Viktor Krum appeared from behind a bookcase.  She felt her forehead burning, but refused to give him the satisfaction of knowing she was nervous.  What could he possibly want to talk to her about?
Then her eyes flicked up to meet his as he took a seat across from her.  He always looked so moody, his shoulders hunched and his eyes cold and unrelenting.  But he was attractive in a way; his dark brown hair shaded intense eyes, and his face was clear and chiseled.
"I hope your studying is going vell," he said suddenly.
Confused, Hermione replied, "Yes, it is."
Viktor Krum took a deep breath, opened his mouth to speak, then closed it.
"Did you need something?" Hermione asked.
"First, I vant to know your name.  I am Viktor Krum."
The entire school knows your name, Hermione thought vindictively.  "I'm Hermione Granger."
"Her-mi-ninny?" he asked uncertainly.
"Hermione," she said, more clearly this time.
"Her-min-ee," he tried again.  "I want to ask if you vill attend the Yule Ball with me this Christmas.  I admire you every day here.  I was too nervous to ask you before.  I thought maybe someone would already ask you to go."
Hermione sat frozen, repeating his words in her head to make sure they were real.  Though his English was flawed, his meaning was clear; he wanted her to go to the Yule Ball with him.  She hadn't thought anyone would ask her, and had planned to go on her own.  But maybe it would be fun to go with someone else.  It would definitely prove to everyone that she wasn't just a lonely bookworm.
"No one's asked me," she said, still pondering whether she should say yes or no. 
What have I got to lose? she thought before finally taking a deep breath and saying, "I'll go with you."
~~~~~~~~~~
"You need three hours to get ready?" Ron yelled across the grounds as Hermione hurried up the castle steps to get ready for the Yule Ball.  She felt herself tingling with anticipation, so much that she couldn't muster up the words to respond.
"Who are you going with?" he yelled.  She waved his words away and disappeared into the castle, breathing heavily like she'd just run a race.  She couldn't understand why she wouldn't tell Harry and Ron she was going to the ball with Viktor Krum.  
She just knew she was exhilarated at the very idea; she'd spent the past few days planning her attire for the night.  She knew they wouldn't believe her if she told them who her date was, so she kept the information to herself and Ginny Weasley, Ron's little sister, who she knew she could trust.
"Why don't you ask Harry to go?" Hermione had asked her one day.  "He doesn't have a date yet."
"I know, it's only..." Ginny began, then faltered.  She'd always had feelings for Harry.  "I feel like I need to take a break from him.  I should make myself happy if he doesn't take the time to notice me."Normally, Hermione would be furious with Harry and attempt to dissuade him from going to Hogwarts to look for this unknown Horcrux.  She would usually tell him to stop listening to the quick visions of Voldemort that he gets, and try to concentrate on the task at hand.  But this last vision had proved useful; Voldemort knew they were killing off Horcruxes, and he revealed that one of them was hidden at Hogwarts.
Aberforth, Professor Dumbledore's brother, had saved them from the Death Eaters in Hogsmeade and with his help they reconnected with Neville, who was now leading them down a dreary, earthy passageway back into the castle.  Hermione was shaking she was so nervous.  She expected Ron to look frightened as well, but in fact, she'd never seen a more serious expression on his face.  It reminded her of the determination and passion she'd seen him exhibit when Bellatrix Lestrange tortured her at the Malfoy Manor.  Even though her body screamed with agony and she could hardly process a single thought, the sight of him fighting for her life so valiantly still brought a warm glow to her whenever she thought of it.
Neville, scarred, bruised, and bloody, showed them into the Room of Requirement, which had been redecorated as a sort of camp for refugee students from Hogwarts.  He explained to them how the new teachers, hired by Voldemort, tortured students on a daily basis and that was why many of them, mostly old Dumbledore's Army members, had taken to hiding in here.
But they discovered a problem.
"We can't tell you what it is exactly," Harry admitted to the students after informing them there was some secret mission they were sent on by Dumbledore.  Harry didn't want to give any information about it.
"Maybe they can help," Hermione offered, hoping that one or more of the students would at least have a suggestion about this last Horcrux, even if they didn't have to know anything about its purpose.
So Harry told them it had to do with Ravenclaw.
"There's her lost diadem," piped up Luna Lovegood.  Hermione usually discredited anything this girl said, but after what she'd gone through to fight against Voldemort, Hermione admired some of her spirit.
The other Ravenclaw students said the diadem was lost for good measure, but Luna insisted Harry see the reproduction of it sitting on the statue of Rowena Ravenclaw in their common room.  So Harry agreed to go with her, leaving Ron and Hermione in the common room surrounded by students eager to ask questions.
"What have you been doing these past few months?"
"How have you not gotten caught?"
"Can you tell us what Harry's looking for?"
"Are you going to stop the Carrows?"
"We - er," Ron began nervously.  "We actually have something to do ourselves."  Hermione pretended like this was the plan all along, nodding with him.  "Tell Harry we went to - er - the bathroom."
Confused, Hermione followed Ron into the hallway, down two corridors, through a secret passageway, and onto a secluded stairway.
"Ron!" she whispered harshly, not wanting Snape or the Carrows to find them.  "Where are we going?  We told Harry we'd wait for him in the Room of Requirement!"
He turned around sharply and gripped her shoulders.  "Hermione, trust me on this.  I thought of how we can destroy this Horcrux."  And he pointed to the bulge in Hermione's robe that held Hufflepuff's cup.  She could feel its cold metal body weighing her down.  Once again, she saw that determined and impassioned look in Ron's face that she rarely ever saw, and it took her breath away.
He sent off at a quick pace to the second floor and led Hermione to the place she least expected: Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.
Moaning Myrtle wasn't present, however.  The room was entirely empty except for Ron and Hermione.A chilling sensation whipped Hermione awake.  Her bushy hair clung to her face in a heavy, matted mess and she was only fully aware of one thing - a warm, panting someone pulling her along in what felt like a thick, muddy lake..
Her dazed state continued for a few more minutes as she and her lifeguard were carried away by the gently bobbing current.  As the chilling feeling grew more intense and began to spread further down her body, she realized it was because they had reached land and that her lifeguard was nearly dragging her along.  
She began to use her own feet, attempting to get accustomed to the abrupt change in temperature.  She had been wrapped up in watery warmth for the past twelve hours or so, and feeling the Earth's wind and bleak February chill nearly froze her to the bone.
As her feet touched dry sand, Hermione finally lifted her hands to clear the mane of heavy wet hair blocking her vision.  When she did, she saw Viktor Krum at her side, his mouth moving frantically.  Then she realized she couldn't hear anything.
She yelled for him to stop, her own voice sounding muffled too.  For the next minute or so she pounded excess water out of her ears until they each popped and she could understand what he was saying.
"Are you all right?" he asked with wide eyes.
She'd just spent the entire night in an entranced sleep under the lake and had been "rescued" - as if there'd been any real danger - by Viktor Krum, the champion who was set to find her.  She blushed as she remembered something from the golden egg's clue - "We've  taken what you'll truly miss."
Was she really the one person Viktor Krum would miss most of all?  Despite the cold, she felt her chest and face set on fire.  At that moment, Madam Pompfrey had encased her in a thick blanket and sat her down to drink some hot potion that made steam come out of her ears.
Only Cedric and Cho had returned so far, and Hermione felt herself getting nervous.  Where could Harry, Ron, Fleur Delacour, and her little sister be?  The hour they had to find the captured people had already passed.  But she had little time to ponder this, for Viktor was pulling her aside, away from Madam Pomfrey, away from Cedric and Cho, and away from all the judges.  They stood sheltered under a thick birch tree at the edge of the lake.
"Hermione," he said, finally beginning to pronounce her name correctly.  "I never felt more worried than ven I saw you tied to that statue."  He stared at her eyes intensely, and she felt hotter and more compressed than ever before.
"Thank you for rescuing me," she said quietly, though she knew there'd been no danger.
"I vant to tell you...something that means very much to me.  You mean more to me than any girl before; you were the one I would miss most of all."
He'd moved closer, and Hermione felt her heart beat pick up.  She could feel his warm breath on her face, and a few drops of water fell from him onto her as he towered above her.  She'd had her doubts about him since he'd asked her to attend the Yule Ball with him, but now...she wasn't sure what she felt.  But she did feel an inexplicable warmth every time she spoke with him.
"Hermione, I want to ask you something."
"Yes, Viktor?" she asked breathlessly.
"I want you to visit me this summer, at Durmstrang.  Come see the mountains and the valleys with me and I will make you happy.  I've never felt this way before, Hermione."
Before she could respond, his head descended until he was at level with her, and he pressed his lips against hers.  They were warm and wet from the water, but she didn't mind - hers were the same.  They kissed for a minute or two, her face growing hot at the thought that people could be watching them.  She broke away.Hermione Granger cringed as yet another barrette found its pointy way into her elaborate up-do.  But even the tedious battle of hair with her mother could not erase the smile on her face; today was her wedding day, and she would marry Ronald Weasley.
Of course her mother Jean had been surprised when she found out Hermione was engaged, because it had happened less than a year after the Battle of Hogwarts.  Getting her parents reaccustomed to British lifestyle took up most of her time, so when they found out she had a boyfriend, they were stunned.
"Mom, dad.  Do you know who I am?" she'd asked them on a sunny beach in Queensland, Australia.
Jean and Wilfred rubbed their heads and looked around in confusion, unsure as to where they were.  
"I'm your daughter, Hermione Granger.  We live in England," she remembered telling them.
"But...this is Australia!" her dad said in confusion.  "Do we have a daughter, Jean?" he asked his wife, as though not entirely sure of the past few decades of his life.
"I...I don't know, WIl.  This is all happening so suddenly."  Jean shook her head, and Hermione blushed at the sand in shame.  How could she have done such a thing to her own parents?
To protect them from Voldemort, she reminded herself fiercely.  Sometimes, hard things must be done to protect the ones she loved.  But now, that was all over.  Voldemort was dead.  They could go back to their lives as family once more.
Of course, Hermione had conversed with an authorized Healer on how to lift the memory charm she'd put on them, but she didn't quite expect how long it would take for them to get all their memories back.  They'd obtained quite a proficient Australian accent while away and simple things like remembering the pound system of British currency was difficult for them.
However, having successfully placed and removed the memory charm from her parents so they would be safe from Voldemort, and having finally reoriented them to British lifestyle - though they still said the word "crikey" too often for Hermione's taste - had actually gained her a job in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.  The Head of Department had said, "Anyone brave enough to do that to their parents can handle the lives of magical creatures."
Not that everything was so peachy directly following the Battle of Hogwarts; informing families of deaths, rebuilding the castle, informing the world of Voldemort's death, and constant debates over how to begin the school year and somehow be able to let go memories of all the terrible things that happened there the year before all generously occupied her time.  Hermione assisted Professor McGonagall, the new Headmistress, greatly in this matter and helped conduct interviews for new professors, since they'd lost a few the year before.
"Let's put on your dress," Jean whispered, clapping Hermione's shoulders with a broad smile and declaring her hair finished.  The last time she'd ever felt this dolled up was for the Yule Ball in her fourth year at Hogwarts.
Despite all the stress surrounding the months after Voldemort's death, Ron had always been there to support Hermione and help out.  She remembered their first date, blushing crimson.
It started raining dreadfully in Hogsmeade, and Honeydukes had lost all its excitement after they were certain to have consumed at least four cavities' worth of sweets.  Her parents would order her to brush her teeth if they'd just seen it happen.
"Let's get a drink at the Three Broomsticks," Ron said with a bright smile, grabbing Hermione's hand and leading her away from the pouring rain into the shelter of Honeydukes.  They laughed all the way, unable to contain their giddiness.  Since that night at Hogwarts, everything between them had changed.Hermione Granger knew that as soon as she sent that letter to Viktor Krum declining his summer invitation, things had changed.  You-Know-Who had returned.  She had just moved into the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, and they began a cleaning attack on the house.  She could feel it as though a dark shroud was descending upon all of them, and her next decisions would be crucial.  Life at Hogwarts, while it had never been easy and carefree, would change forever.
While they were prohibited from attending Order of the Phoenix meetings since they were still in school, the Weasley children and Hermione exhausted all their efforts on cleaning the headquarters, which was in Sirius Black's childhood home, and trying to listen in on meetings.  Order members came and went as they pleased, always talking in hushed voices and ignoring the underage household members.
Fred and George Weasley had created Extendable Ears, which allowed them to listen to conversations; it was one of their many inventions for the joke shop they wanted to open.  So far, they'd just learned that Harry Potter was being guarded extensively.  Hermione wished she could tell him what was happening because he'd been left in the dark all summer.  But Professor Dumbledore had forbidden them from doing so.
"You must not tell Harry about the Order.  He will learn of it when the time comes.  For now, rest assured he is safe and will be with you soon."
So Hermione spent her summer cleaning, eavesdropping, spending time with Ron and Ginny, writing to her parents, and dreading the moment Harry got a hold of them.  Every letter he sent was full of questions they could not answer, had promised Professor Dumbledore they would not.  They were mostly questions they themselves didn't know the answers to because they weren't official Order members.
So it was with trepidation that Hermione listened to Mrs. Weasley one morning as she went on about plans for bringing Harry from the Dursley's house.  She and Ron looked at each other, each bearing the wounds from Harry's owl, Hedwig, who kept pecking at them because they wouldn't respond to Harry's letters.  
He'd been attacked by Dementors, and that brought on the necessity for his rapid removal from Privet Drive.  But Professor Dumbledore had once again asked them not to say anything, since things were getting very dangerous and letters could be intercepted.  Hermione, though dreading Harry's reaction, heeded the professor's word without complaint.  He had his reasons, as Mrs. Weasley said numerous times.
Ron, however, didn't take the obligation so calmly.  "Harry should be here, he's done more with You-Know-Who than the rest of them combined!"
While Hermione agreed with that, she knew there must be some greater purpose to Professor Dumbledore's command, so she reined in Ron's desperate desire to write the truth to Harry.
"We'll explain everything when he gets here, he'll understand," she reassured him for the thousandth time.  But now that he was coming, they both knew those words were meaningless.  They'd have to apologize a hundred times for their complete ignorance of his questions and desire to escape Privet Drive.  So they continued their chores that day very nervously, jumping at every ring of the doorbell.
She and Ron heard the numerous locks click open, Tonks trip over the troll stand, and Mrs. Black begin to scream.  They placed themselves in front of the door to Ron's room, waiting for Harry to ascend the stairs, their hearts pounding.
When the door to the room opened, Hermione felt the lies roll off her tongue like water.
"Harry!  Ron, Harry's here!  We didn't hear you come!  How are you?  Are you okay?  Are you mad at us?  I'm sure you must be, in the letters we didn't tell you anything, it's that we couldn't, Dumbledore made us promise we wouldn't tell you anything, oh, we have so many things to tell us, and you too, dementors!  When we found out, and about the Ministry...It's outrageous.  I've been looking up information and they can't expel you, they simply can't, it states specifically in the Decree for Limitation of Witchcraft in those underage in life-threatening situations-"Every tick of the second hand on Hermione's watch sounded like a gong going off, and reminded Hermione of the sweat slowly trickling off her brow.  All Harry had given them to protect themselves with was the Marauder's Map and this small, hardly consequential vial of Felix Felicis in which she used to put her faith entirely, but now felt doubts creeping up from all sides. She, Ron, and Ginny stood in a triangular formation holding cups with servings of the potion a little after midnight.
Ron's red face was screwed up in concentration and glistening with sweat.   Ginny shook visibly.  Hermione, meanwhile, licked her dry lips compulsively and tried not to listen to the yelling and crashing sounds coming from the floor above.
"On three?” Ginny whispered.  They all nodded.  “One...”
Where could Harry and Professor Dumbledore be? Hermione thought frantically.  They'd been gone for hours!
“Two.”  The temperature of the common room seemed to increase by one hundred degrees every second.
Hermione took a deep breath.  All they'd seen was the Dark Mark appear in the sky from a large window in the Gryffindor common room; it was above the astronomy tower.  A few minutes later, the screams began.  And they knew Harry was right; Voldemort's plague had fallen upon Hogwarts when Dumbledore had left.  Whether Harry's suspicions that Draco Malfoy or Severus Snape had anything to do with it were yet unclear.
“Three!” Ginny said, with a braver voice this time.
They all chugged the Felix Felicis.  As a tingling, lightweight sensation spread throughout their bodies, they each felt their minds clear.
Filled with vigor, they sped off through the portrait hole to face the night, all fears forgotten.
~~~~~~~~~~
Trailed by a few members of Dumbledore's Army, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny grasped onto the dark wall in the corridor, following Malfoy as quickly as they could.  Everything was happening in a blur.  They'd sped off to the Room of Requirement as fast as they could as Harry had instructed them, telling them Malfoy was up to something in there and that they should stalk him and find out what it was, that he would take his shot at whatever plan he had now that Dumbledore was away from school.
But Malfoy had gotten there first.  While Harry was gone, they were the only ones who could put a stop to whatever Malfoy was up to.
As soon as he came into the hallway and saw the group there, he threw some black powder into the air that made everything dark.  He had a hand sculpture that gave light to him but no one else, and any spell the DA tried to bring light to the corridor did not work.  So they followed after Malfoy with the blind but accurate senses lent to them by Felix Felicis, not knowing where he led them.
The screams and crashes from earlier grew only more audible as they ascended a staircase.  But Hermione knew they would make it out safely.  Suddenly, intuition hit her: "Duck!" she yelled, and pulled as many friends down with her as she could.  Not a moment later, a jet of green light pierced the darkness where their own feeble spells could not.  Someone had just sent a killing curse at them.
The lights turned back on as they rounded a corner, and they were faced with a grand sight: no less than fifty cloaked and masked figures stood leering at them with their wands pointed at each Dumbledore Army's member's chest.  They'd landed close to the Astronomy tower, but Malfoy was nowhere to be seen.  He must have escaped despite their efforts.  Had it not been for the luck of Felix Felicis, Hermione knew they would all die.
Instead they battled fiercely and spells either ricocheted off them or missed them entirely.  The Death Eaters were dumbfounded.  Hermione fought a big, blundering one that kept trying to send a killing curse her way, but she evaded everyone and eventually managed to stun him.  She leapt to the next Death Eater in her way, a tall, gangling one that preferred burning hexes and slashing movements to regular old killing curses.Towering walls of small glass spheres closed in around them, making Hermione claustrophobic.  The dust seemed to catch in the air and she tried her hardest not to cough or sneeze; she felt that she should be quiet among these strange spheres full of floating mist, like a crystal ball, only they seemed more sinister, more secretive.
The only thing breaking the silence was Harry's constant yelling of, "Sirius!  Sirius!"  They came here on a vision he'd had of his godfather being tortured by Lord Voldemort for information.  They'd traversed the lowest, darkest, strangest floor of the Ministry of Magic after the building was closed for the day and had found this strange room where Sirius was supposed to be.
But he was nowhere to be found.  Hermione refrained from telling Harry that she'd told him so, but she sincerely couldn't wait to get out of the cold, dark place.
"Harry!  Have you seen this?" Ron's voice rang out suddenly.
"What?" Harry said, coming over.  Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna all walked over to read a certain glass sphere that Ron was pointing out.  It was high up, so Hermione had to squint to read it.
SPT to APWBD
Dark Lord and (?) Harry Potter
They all stared, not knowing what it could mean.
"What is it?" Ron asked.  He scanned the surrounding shelves.  "My name isn't here.  No one else's is."
Harry reached out his hand to grab the sphere, but Hermione stopped him.  "I don't think you should touch it, Harry."
But he insisted, and as though drawn to the cold little sphere, Harry's fingers closed around it.  As soon as they did, the group knew it was not alone.
"Very good, Potter.  Now turn around, slowly, and hand that to me."  It was Lucius Malfoy's voice.
And suddenly, the six of them were surrounded on all sides by tall, leering, masked and cloaked figures pointing wands at them.  Death Eaters.
"Where's Sirius?" Harry asked, but the Death Eaters simply laughed at him.
"The Dark Lord is never wrong!" a female voice said wonderingly.
"No, he's not," said Malfoy, laughing again.  "Now, give me the prophecy, Potter."
A prophecy!  About Harry and Voldemort? Hermione thought, wondering frantically what that could mean.  But if the Death Eaters wanted it so badly, why couldn't they have come here themselves to get it?  Why trick Harry into coming?
As they argued back and forth, Hermione let out a small gasp when someone stepped on her foot.  Then, she heard Harry's voice.  "Smash shelves...when I say go."
She couldn't give him any hint that she'd heard him, but she quickly passed the message to the others.  Heart beating fast, she kept her wand held tightly in her hand, sweat dripping all over it.
"NOW!" Harry yelled.
"REDUCTO!" rang all six of their voices, pointing their wands at the shelves.  Crystal spheres began to fall in earnest as the shelves broke, all around the Death Eaters.
They flew.  Harry grabbed onto Hermione's robe and Hermione could hear Neville blundering after them.
They ran down a random hallway, through a door and into a room, and Hermione shut the door with a spell.  They heard a few bodies of Death Eaters slam against it.
But where could Ron, Luna, and Ginny be? she thought frantically.  They were in a room they'd gone to before, with a bird in a glass box that kept floating down and turning back into an egg, then floating up and becoming old again.When Hermione entered the Great Hall on Valentine's Day it was to discover a very put-out looking Ron.  She instantly knew why: the walls were covered in bright pink and red roses and confetti fell from the ceiling, which was enchanted to look like a pale blue sky today.  Gilderoy Lockhart, her only idol, stood at the top of the professors' table and was motioning for them to quiet down.
She breathed in the fresh scent of the roses and sat down next to Ron, who didn't say a word but continued staring at Lockhart as though the man were something particularly nasty he'd discovered on the bottom of his shoe.  Hermione had a suspicion about what Lockhart could be up to, but she was too giddy to think about it.
"Happy Valentine's Day!" Lockhart exclaimed around the time Harry entered the Great Hall and sat next to them, a look of utmost puzzlement on his face.  "I want to start by thanking the 46 people who sent me cards.  As you see, I've taken the liberty to prepare this little surprise, but it's not finished quite yet!"
He clapped his hands and the Great Hall doors opened, revealing a dozen little gnomes with golden wings carrying harps.  They were cupids.  Hermione let out a sigh of appreciation, ignoring Ron's scoff.
"Here are your cupid message carriers!  All day, they'll transmit your Valentine's Day messages around the school!  But that's not all!  I'm sure my colleagues won't mind getting into the spirit!  Why don't you ask Professor Snape to show you how to make a love potion?  And Professor Flitwick knows more about seduction charms that any other wizard I've met, the sly old dog!"
"Hermione," said Ron suddenly.  "Tell me you weren't one of the 46 who sent him cards."
Hermione blushed and didn't respond; she had indeed sent Lockhart a Valentine's day card, but it was merely expressing how impressed she was reading the book Travels with Trolls for the tenth time.  She found it inspiring that someone looked down upon and ridiculed for most of her childhood could stand up and defend the defenseless with his outstanding magical capability.  Someone like a mudblood - the word rang in her ears months after Malfoy had first used it against her.  Someone like her.
~~~~~~~~~~
"But what if Hagrid wasn't guilty?  What if it was some other monster attacking the students?" Hermione asked, playing the devil's advocate, trying to convince Harry and Ron that what Harry had seen the night before in Tom Riddle's diary was not to be trusted 100%; that Hagrid may not have been responsible for the last time the Chamber of Secrets had opened.
The castle was in a panic since the chamber was announced to be open, with a bloodthirsty monster that roamed around the school, paralyzing muggle-borns at random.  The feeling literally haunted Hermione, but deep in her heart she knew she needed to keep a brave face.  For if any of the students were to figure out the cause of this problem, it would most likely be her, Ron, and Harry.
"How many monsters do you think can fit in this castle?" asked Ron somberly.
"We always knew Hagrid had been expelled, but not why," Harry said.  "The attacks must have stopped after Hagrid was expelled, otherwise Riddle wouldn't have gotten his reward."
Hermione thought differently; what if the real heir of Slytherin realized that he'd been redeemed and could escape with no one the wiser of his true nature once Hagrid was charged for the attacks, as long as he stopped attacking right after the expulsion?  But she didn't say so; she was deep in thought about the attacks.  While she stayed in the conversation and they debated whether they should go ask Hagrid about the matter, her mind wandered to the scenes of the actual attacks.  
Mrs. Norris, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Colin Creevey, Nearly Headless Nick.  All of them should have died, but none of them did.  They were paralyzed.  Hermione realized that her first order of business was to look up what creatures had the ability to paralyze humans.  Then, she would spend her time figuring out why they were only paralyzed, not killed.Steam poured out of the top of the scarlet Hogwarts Express as it geared up for another year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Teddy Lupin's owl hooted uncontrollably with excitement as the fourth year pushed his cart past milling students and sobbing parents.
"Fourth year, that's a big one," said Harry Potter, Teddy's uncle. He smiled, small wrinkles forming at the corners of his eyes.
"Eh, it's all the same," Teddy said, shrugging. He was really looking for Victoire. They practically grew up together, and she was his best friend when she started Hogwarts last year. She was really shy and hardly talked to anyone at the school, so he hoped she was doing okay alone right now.
"Have you seen Victoire?"
His godfather gave a knowing smile. "She should already be here, Bill and Fleur said they would come early. I'm sure you'll find her compartment."
As usual, random adults would wave to Harry, many stopping whatever they were doing to stare at him. James was used to this behavior around his uncle by now, though he never knew why it was always like this until barely a month ago.
Teddy had been staying over the Potters' house for most of the summer, and after James and Albus got tired from their Quidditch fight and went to bed, he stayed up drawing. He got bored and heard voices from Harry and Ginny's room. He didn't understand why he did it, but he got up and went to listen at the door, because it sounded like an argument.
"Harry, I know you're the Chosen One and everything, but sometimes you're just wrong. The Magpies did beat the Cannons in 98, I don't think you'd remember because you were tracking down Horcruxes!"
Though Teddy didn't really understand the conversation, he heard Harry laugh and knew it was just a silly fight, nothing serious. He kneeled on the carpet outside the room twirling a stray piece of thread around his finger.
"You're right, I'll go ask Voldemort what happened. Maybe he'll remember."
Teddy understood that part of the conversation: he knew who Voldemort was because of his outdated History of Magic textbooks, and he knew from conversations with his grandmother than Voldemort was dead. But he didn't know why Harry and Ginny were talking about him so personally.
So he cornered Ginny the next morning and threatened to not keep James and Albus busy on weekends anymore if she didn't tell him.
Terrified by the idea that her two pre-teen sons would overrun the house without Teddy to entertain them, Ginny broke down and agreed. She decided he was old enough to know the truth anyway.
Back on Platform 9 3/4, Teddy looked up and grinned widely at his godfather. "Now I know why they're all staring at you!"
"Mmm, yes," Harry admitted begrudgingly. "Teddy, I know you've already promised this a hundred times, but please don't tell James, Albus and Lily what you know. They're too young to know the truth."
"Alright," Teddy grumbled, obliged to keep the coolest secret of the decade to himself. Then an idea came to him. "Is Victoire old enough to know?"
"She already knows. Bill told her."
Teddy felt a lump in his throat. His hair immediately turned a furious red color from its usual brown. "What? But she's younger than me, she's a second year! Why does she know?" He actually couldn't wait to find her; they'd talk about it the whole train ride to Hogwarts.
"Ask Bill," Harry said with a shrug.
Teddy boarded the train ten minutes later without difficulty and quickly found Victoire. Her part-Veela blond hair had gotten even longer in the weeks since he'd seen her. After complaining that she never told him what she knew, they both plunged into a deep conversation about Harry and what he, Ron and Hermione had done when they were in Hogwarts.The common room was nearly empty as almost all the Gryffindors were still at dinner. Hermione was using the time to catch up on her Charms homework - she was supposed to remain three weeks ahead in assignments and studying but she'd fallen back a few days and desperately needed to remedy that.
A flickering candle lightened and darkened her notes periodically. She sighed and put down her quill to look out of the window at the still-bright sky. Spring was here and the sun was out later; just the thought put a smile on her face. In fact, she'd been smiling a whole lot that week, and while she'd never fully admit it to herself, she did recognize one reason why that might be.
Ron and Lavender had broken up less than a week ago, but already Ron seemed to be over it. He'd been wanting to break up with Lavender for quite some time, but his unconscious state and muttering of Hermione's name while asleep - something he had no recollection of - had sped up the process.
She smiled again, not exactly knowing why. By the time Ron realized they were good for each other, Dolores Umbridge would announce equal rights for centaurs and wizards.
Then she sighed and went back to her work, pulling her thick brown hair out of her eyes. As she did, the portrait door swung open and Ron walked in with a sheepish expression.
She waited for him to come over, her heart beating at an unprecedented face, and watched as he sat quietly in the armchair across from her.
"Where's Harry?" he asked.
"With Dumbledore, I expect," she responded, trying to prevent a blush from creeping up her cheeks. Why was it so hard to control herself around him? she scolded herself.
Her anger must have shown on her face, for Ron asked with a frown, "You alright?"
"Yes!" she said immediately. "Everything's fine. How was dinner?"
His freckled face immediately lit up. "Oh, they had the best mashed potatoes - Why weren't you there?"
Hermione shrugged. "Wanted to catch up on homework."
Years ago, Ron would have complained and said that homework could wait for after dinner. But he knew Hermione well enough by now to just say, "Oh, alright."
Then he pulled out a piece of parchment and she was thrilled to be able to study together, but then he started tracing the outline of some kind of animal.
"What are you drawing?" she asked curiously.
"A dragon battling an acromantula. I want to see who would win."
"A dragon, of course!" She snorted and threw down her quill. Homework obviously wasn't going to happen.
"Hermione," Ron began seriously, looking up from his amateur work. "You haven't met Aragog. That thing was mad! All hairy legs and a thousand eyes, it looked like it could eat you!"
"You might be scared of a few spiders in the forest, but-"
"A few spiders?" Ron's voice rose to a high pitch. "Hermione, there's hundreds in his family! Then all the little ones, you remember the ones that crawled all over the castle second year!"
"Dragons can breathe fire and fly, Ron! A few long legs and creepy eyes won't stop them from incinerating a stupid spider, no matter how big it is!"
Ron sat and thought about this for a minute, then scrapped his drawing. "Alright. Ruin my dream of being an artist. Hey, what are you doing right now?"
"Didn't I already tell you I'm doing homework? Or trying, at least." Her previous happiness at having him back in her life and away from Lavender was starting to dissipate. Had she forgotten how thick he could be sometimes?A light tapping sound was the only thing to be heard in the dungeons. Only the ghosts and Jessie went down here, and occasionally the caretaker Oak when there was a bad leak. When Jessie was a child, she went past the marble floors above, beyond the dungeon classrooms where Potions lessons were held, lower than the kitchens and Hufflepuff and Slytherin common rooms. They never scared her.
There was no light, so she'd lit her wand and followed it like a beacon down here. She tried not to breathe very loudly, as though it would disturb something.
Jessie lifted her black curls into a ponytail to welcome the cool air; the Great Hall upstairs had gotten far too stuffy for her liking. It was yet another Welcoming Feast, and she was really only there for moral support; it was Fred's first year as a real Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, after all.
Professor McGonagall, her mother - for all intents and purposes - was glad to see her sit at the old Slytherin table instead of the seat offered to her at the High Table. Mostly, Jessie had been excited to see all her old ghost friends, especially Peeves.
In her third year, after a particularly annoying incident where he lifted a carpet from under her feet and wrapped it all around her, leaving her at the bottom of a staircase for Teddy to find an hour later, Jessie chased him down and locked him in place with her magic.
His poltergeist, little black eyes grew big and round and he begged her not to hurt him. She knew her magic was powerful, but to see fearless Peeves so scared made her falter. Maybe she was hurting him.
"Why are you the only ghost here that doesn't like me? I've known you since I was a baby, and you still treat me like a regular student," she'd accused him. It turned out she was the only student he’d ever been afraid of.
They became friends after that, and Jessie got to know the real Peeves: the soul behind the trickster. Just one more addition to her small group of mismatched friends: Teddy, the metamorphmagus; Victoire, the part-Veela bookworm; and now Peeves, the poltergeist who really had no other friends but her.
"Peeves," she whispered now into the dark dungeons, hoping he was down here. It was one of his favorite spots to come to when he was upset. She'd seen him in the Great Hall looking very put-out. He hadn't even glided over to sit next to her and blow into the other students' ears. After about a half-hour of moodily blowing boogies onto some first years' potatoes, he crossed his arms and zoomed cross-legged out of the hall. Needless to say, she followed soon after the Welcoming Speech.
A sniffling met her ears. She rolled her big black eyes; as if poltergeists could cry.
"What's wrong? I bet I can guess."
A loud raspberry met her ears, and a gust of wind hit her in the face.
"Humph!" came Peeves' voice. He was nearby somewhere, invisible. "Acting like you know me that well, I'll have you know, nothing is bothering me! I'm Peeves, aren't I? I never-"
While he babbled, Jessie closed her eyes and felt the air around her. It was one of her gifts in magic that she didn't like to reveal to others. Then she reached out a meter to her left and pulled a little orange shoe, which was on a short, plump body, and Peeves' invisible disguise fell away.
"What did the Baron say this time?" she asked with a smirk.
His mouth opened and closed, jostling his thin moustache, and he turned his back on her. His striped costume seemed to mock her.
"You know, you need to stop showing off your powers. People will wonder where you got them from."
She rolled her eyes again. "Like they don't already know." She was long used to her ancestry with the Riddles being a problem for her. They certainly caused questions all through schooling and when she applied to the Department of Magical Transportation. At least only Teddy, Victoire, Professor McGonagall, Fred, and Peeves knew exactly who her parents were: Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange.“Did you see the way he caught that bloody Snitch? Of course he’ll be a champion!” Ron defended himself to an irate Hermione while grabbing yet another drumstick from the plate in front of him. 

The Great Hall was much more crowded than usual with the addition of a few hundred Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students. That, coupled with the Halloween decorations, made the whole school bloom with excitement and debate about who would be chosen for Triwizard Champion from each school.

“I was there, Ronald, of course I remember,” Hermione said with her arms crossed. She’d already finished eating and was more than determined to get back to studying. She liked a good game like anyone else, but enough was enough with the speculation. Call the names so she can go to the library! “I just think that maybe the Goblet would be more willing to choose someone who has brains, not just someone who can catch a Snitch. I don’t think the Goblet will consider that a worthy skill.”

“Not consider it a worthy skill?” Ron blustered. Seamus Finnegan next to him started up.

“Hermione, these are challenges the champions are facing, not exams.” He shook his sandy hair covered head. “A bit of athletic skill could come in handy on top of magic. Wizards have died before and not just from bad charming!”

“Who do you think will get it, Hermione?” asked Harry, who’d been staring at the Ravenclaw table for the past few minutes rather than joining in the conversation.

“Don’t say it, not him!” Ron interrupted before Hermione could even open her mouth.

“Don’t say what, exactly?” she asked, reciting the day’s Transfiguration lesson in her mind while only half-heartedly listening.

“You know!” Ron shouted. Then he lowered his voice to a whisper, “Cedric.”

“At least Cedric is intelligent. He can play Quidditch too, you know.”

Ron rolled his eyes and looked at Harry meaningfully. “And he’s good-looking,” he muttered to his friend under his breath.

The lights dimmed and Professor Dumbledore stood at the teachers’ table. He raised his hands to the students assembled and naturally, they quieted down.

“Good evening to all of you gathered,” came his booming voice. A bangle on his beard twinkled in the strong candlelight. A coffin-like box rested directly in front of the table with the Goblet of Fire sitting tall on top. Its light was one of the few left in the Great Hall, blue and flickering even higher than Dumbledore’s head.

“I hope you are all well-fed and -watered. Tonight is a momentous occasion, as we have not had the Triwizard Tournament in so many years. The Champions selected tonight will lead their schools through challenging tasks, and because of this, the Goblet of Fire has selected only the students it deems most worthy from each school. You must all support your school’s champion, as they will carry both this burden and glory until the end of the school year.”

He tapped the Goblet of Fire once with his wand and after a moment of dead silence, a red flame shot upwards. Shielding his eyes, Dumbledore grabbed a piece of paper that fell out of the flame a moment later.<strong>Author's Note: This is the third installment of the It Doesn't Matter series, which I'm thinking about turning into a short story or novella. It's about Jessie Riddle, daughter of Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange. If you want to read the other installments, you can go to One-shot Request #11 and #13. This is the prequel of those, though you don't need to read them in order to understand this.</strong>

If there were any staff member at Hogwarts who didn't like Jessie, it would be Madam Pince. Jessie jogged down the corridor away from the library, grateful to escape the librarian's hateful glare.
She wasn't sure exactly why Madam Pince hated her so much. All the other teachers loved that she read often. She took out one new book from the library each day, and Madam Pince always complained that maybe other students would need it while Jessie hadn't even been admitted to Hogwarts yet.
But then again, Jessie's mother was Headmistress McGonagall, so Madam Pince couldn't really do anything about it.
Jessie took one of her favorite secret passageways: through a door that was as small as her toe at first glance, but once she kicked it, it enlarged to a size she could crawl through. She made her way on the floor, happy she was still small enough to fit through. It would be three more years before she'd get to take classes at Hogwarts, after all.
On the other side was her favorite hiding place, one that maybe only the ghosts knew about. For who else, other than Jessie and maybe the tiniest first year, could fit into that door? ANd only she had discovered it. Crawling through led to a small room, hardly larger than a teacher's office, with one large painting of a unicorn, a fluffy brown couch, and a plush red carpet.
Though she knew no one was here, Jessie looked around once nervously before placing her hands on the couch. Somehow, young though she was, she had an excellent gift for Transfiguration. Her mother was, after all, a Transfiguration expert.
After a few moments of concentration, the front of the couch sunk down into a slanted sort of pillow so she could comfortably lean back on it and read while stretching her feet on the floor.
Jessie grinned with the power of her own magic. She hadn't even seen seventh years try anything similar.
Today's book was Charms of Italian Witch Clans. Jessie had an organized system for choosing which book to read; she switched section and shelf of the library in a certain order each day so she would always have a book from a different section and be able to keep track of how close she was to completing the entire library. She still had a long way to go, but ten more years to do it with!
Her eyes slid shut after three hours of reading on the secret spells the Italian witches made to help the muggles in nearby villages. The book fell open on the floor at her feet.
"I dearsay, Jessie! Alone in here again. Mind some company?"
Her eyes flicked open and she yawned in greeting to the Fat Friar who joined her here at least once a week.
“Happy Deathday, Friar!” Jessie said, crossing her legs and blinking to clear the sleep from her eyes.
“Very happy indeed!” The Friar grinned and floated next to her with his own legs crossed. “You’re coming to the festivities tonight, aren’t you?”
“At the lake at dinner. I’ll definitely be there.”
A ghost’s Deathday was a very significant celebration for ghosts - indeed, it was really their only celebration, so they went all out with decorations and food.
Before heading down to the lake, Jessie ate some potatoes at the high table; having attended nearly every Deathday in the castle since she was five-years-old, she was well aware that ghost food was unfit for the living.A final wave of irritation roared through Ginny when Dean put his hands on her to help her get into the common room.
“Dean, let go!” she rounded on him, sick of his patronization of her. “I can walk into the common room just fine on my own, I’ve been doing it for years.”
“What are you talking about?” he shouted, backing away from her.
“You always try to help me do things, like I’m a child!”
“I didn’t help you do anything!” he raised his hands, pleading with her, but she’d had enough of it.
“I don’t care what you think you did or didn’t do, Dean, I need someone who respects me! Not someone who treats me like a child.” She tossed her fiery red hair over her shoulder to look him squarely in the face so he’d take her seriously for once. “I’m done. We’re done. Enjoy the rest of term, Dean.”
With that, she turned on her heel and entered the portrait hole perfectly fine on her own.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ginny listened to the sounds of her shoes clacking against the marble floor on her way to Charms class, trying not to think of Dean or Harry. Dean was miserable since she’d broken up with him. She felt slightly bad, only because she hadn’t wanted to hurt his feelings. But she honestly didn’t miss him at all.
Harry, on the other hand...Yes, she’d managed to put him aside for the past few years, but that didn’t meant he wasn’t in her thoughts anyway! Once she’d broken up with Dean, Harry became even more attractive to her than before. Butterflies squirmed in her stomach every time she talked to him, and she knew her blush was nearly the same color as her hair.
A sharp scream startled her and stopped her in her tracks.
“Who was that?” Ginny asked quietly to the open air. She was alone in the corridor and flicked her head left and right, trying to locate the source of the scream.
“Noooooo!” the voice wailed, and Ginny recognized it instantly. It was coming from the girls’ bathroom. 
“Moaning Myrtle?” she wondered aloud. Then, as quietly as possible, she inched her way toward the door. Myrtle crying wasn’t out of the ordinary, but this time she was screaming as though in danger. But what could hurt a ghost?
Ginny opened the door to the bathroom as quietly as she could, and almost vomited at the sight that met her eyes. She closed the door quickly and leaned against it, panting.
She’d seen Draco Malfoy on the ground with blood streaming out of him! Moaning Myrtle floated above him, her face stretched in anguish. Draco’s blood nearly covered the floor around him.
Not knowing what to do, she ran. She had to find the first teacher available, or Madam Pomfrey if possible!
As she rounded the corner, her wish was granted: she bumped headfirst into Professor Snape and nearly fell backwards.
Mollified, he wiped the spot on his robes where she’d run into it. His greasy black hair fell in front of his face.
“Watch where you’re running to, Weasley! Five points from Gryffindor for-”
“Professor Snape, Malfoy’s been injured! Go to the girls’ bathroom on this floor!” she yelled at him, not caring how many points he took from her House. Malfoy may be a repulsive snob, but he needed help.
Snape gave her one calculating look, then sped off in the direction of the bathrooms.
Unable to help herself, Ginny peeked around the corner to watch what was happening. At first, she couldn’t hear anything other than mumbling.
